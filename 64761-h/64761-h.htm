  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>There appears to be an idea abroad to the effect that the
“Humour of Holland” could be most satisfactorily
dealt with in a chapter resembling the famous one “Of Snakes
in Ireland.” As the average English reader, in the most favourable
instances, knows little more of Dutch literature than a
name or two (Rembrandt has introduced us to “the poet
Vondel,” and if Southey were not so little read in these days
Bilderdijk and Cats would not be so unfamiliar), the subject
offers a free field to the constructive imagination. Yet even so,
one would think it must be obvious that the nation which has
produced a Teniers, a Jan Steen, and—in some of his moods—a
Rembrandt, could not be entirely destitute of humour. The
estimate of its quality may be a question of taste; but—though
many people practically do adopt this form of logic—we cannot
make the fact of our not finding it to our liking a ground for
denying its existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, before determining what the humour of a nation is
like, we need to know what is that nation’s intellectual bent as a
whole, and what forces have been at work to determine its
character. On this point we may quote a paragraph or two from
a Dutch writer, J. H. Hooijer, whom we shall meet again in the
course of these pages. He is describing a village in North
Holland, in the heart of the fat meadow-lands, famous for the
production of Dutch cheeses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same village which you find so depressing this
November day,—so damp, so clammy, so dripping with water,—makes
a very different impression when Spring, with full hands,
has showered her blossom-snow over the orchards, or in the
autumn, when the trees are hanging full of golden pears or rosy
apples. Greener meadow-land is nowhere on earth, unless it
be in the Emerald Isle itself. The rich green pastures have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>velvety lights in the sunshine, and the splendid cattle—their
dappled skins smooth and shining as silk—show out to
advantage against it—colour on colour. At such times there
is a glow of colour in the whole landscape, which, strange as it
may sound, reminds one of the South,—a glow one might
almost think was stolen from the palettes of the Old Masters.
Every breath you draw is perfumed with new milk and flowers,
mingled with the salt smell of the sea. There is a fulness of outward
life—a bubbling up and overflowing of vital juices,—for
which they had an eye and a heart, those great old realists. The
man who despises a rich clover pasture, speckled here and there
with white-fleeced sheep; who cannot spare a look for the
magnificent horned cattle that stand staring at you, with dreamy,
half-sad gaze, over the fence, while Geertje’s black eyes flash
at you from behind the milking-pail,—well, he need not come to
North Holland. Intellects of this sort, exclusively devoted to
the contemplation of the sublime, will find everything ugly in
these parts. To such an one our Old Masters have nothing to
say; for him, Paul Potter’s art is a mere waste of time, and
many a racy bit of Vondel trivial nonsense. Happily the
cheery sun is of another mind, and his smile falls well-pleased
on the endless emerald plain. He nurses it, feeds it, warms it,—he
sweetens the blades of grass for the palate of the pampered
cow. And sometimes, just before setting, he draws along the
horizon, with purple finger, broad streaks of crimson fire, and
then the dykes flame out like ruby bands winding over the
green velvet robe of the earth, and you wish for the power of
wielding the brush, so as to throw on canvas what one might
almost call these brutal effects of colour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here we have a fertile country, with the means of existence
in plenty, but not one where it is easy to live without hard
work. These rich meadow-lands have been wrung from the
sea by the painful toil of centuries, and are only held by the
tenure of constant vigilance. But the struggle for existence is
not hard enough to exhaust the vital energies, and produce
a stunted careworn race. There is abundance of rough but
wholesome food, such as results in strong limbs and clear skins;
there is leisure for dancing and play—rough horse-play though
it may be—when work is done; that there is a recognised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>place in life for mere beauty and luxury, is shown in the gold
head-ornaments of the women. There are no mountains to
suggest the sense of remoteness and mystery; and the grey
North Sea, with its sands and mud-flats, is rather a fact to be
accepted, a foe to be struggled with, in a grim matter-of-course
way from day to day, than the weird terror that the ocean is to
more imaginative peoples. But within the narrow and well-ordered
bounds of farm and homestead, there is a richness of
colour to fire the painter’s eye; the skies and sunsets are the
glorious ones that flame over fen and marshland, and winter
brings the joy of glittering ice and ringing skates. Life is and
has been less bare and hard than of old in Scotland; but on
the whole, the history of the two nations is somewhat similar,
and they have many points of character in common.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both learned thrift, endurance, and foresight in a hard school;
both early acquired the inconvenient habit of thinking for themselves
and dispensing with any mental spectacles save those of
their own choosing; and both displayed a bull-dog tenacity in
holding by their hardly won rights. But after the Reformation
a marked difference becomes evident. Scotland only emerged
from the troubles of that epoch to encounter the religious
persecution of the Stuarts. The seventeenth century was fruitful
of heroism; it tried the national character as by fire, and
developed its sterner and deeper elements; it was not unfavourable
even to tenderness, of a rugged and undemonstrative
character, but the lighter side of life was left, for the time being,
entirely in abeyance. In the quieter time which succeeded the
Union, reaction soon became stagnation. The fiery earnestness,—call
it fanaticism, if you like,—which had been so tremendous a
force in action and endurance, now became a sour harsh
bigotry, lying like a leaden weight on men’s lives. It is one
thing to be in such deadly earnest over an urgent crisis, that
you have no time or inclination to admire a picture or laugh at
a joke; it is another to forbid such enjoyment to other people,
because it is inconsistent with the attitude of mind proper to the
crisis that is over and past. We all have <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les défauts de nos
qualités</span></i>; and the mistakes of reformers include a tendency to
regard the conclusions at which they have arrived as final, and
an imperfect estimate of the relative value of means and ends—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>other words, the inability to see when a truth (that is to say,
any particular statement of a truth) has done its work. This
general state of flatness and dulness could only be ended by a
volcanic outburst,—and such a one came in with Burns.</p>

<p class='c009'>To return to Holland. The shaking off of the Spanish yoke
was followed by a period of peace and prosperity. Dutch ships
had for some time past been bringing home the wealth of
the Indies. Dutch admirals were finding their way into unknown
seas. Colonies sprang up in the Spice Islands, and the
money gained by trade turned the swamps reclaimed from the
sea into flower-gardens, or covered them with stately buildings.
Wealthy burghers, even of the strictest Calvinist persuasion, did
not appear to find their Protestant principles an obstacle to the
encouragement of painters and poets. Roemer Visscher and
his daughters, though members of the defeated and unpopular
church, kept open house at Amsterdam for all who loved art
and letters, and assembled round them the best wits of the time.
Gerbrand Bredero, painter and poet both, belonged to a
respectable burgher family, who—though grieved by the excesses
of his riotous youth, and sorely troubled by his contemplated
marriage with Alida Jansdoter, the pretty but characterless
widow who kept the Toren van Monnickendam tavern—do not
appear to have mourned over his choice of a vocation, or
regarded his plays as anything to disapprove of. Joost van den
Vondel, the tragic poet (in whose genius some have found an
excuse for belittling that of our own Milton), was a deeply
religious man; and though he seems to have suffered from the
aspersions of the religious, it was not so much on account of
his poems, as because he was a Baptist, and they Reformed
Calvinists. No doubt there <em>was</em> religious bigotry in Holland,
but there were also elements of healthy life which kept it in
check. And there was a time when thought became dull and
stagnant,—when the dead-weight of the commonplace, backed
by the double sanction of social and religious orthodoxy, forced
all individuality into its own prepared mould,—when the Dominie
looked with suspicion on every independent expression of
opinion, and the “Pious” kept a watchful eye on the Dominie,—but
that time was not yet. Betje Wolff, who suffered in her
youth from Cornelia Slimpslamp and Brother Benjamin,—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>never forgot it,—came in for part of it; but the worst was
not till after she and her friend Aagje had been laid to rest
side by side. That was the darkness just before the dawn; for
surely there never was such a world of dead forms and petty
conventions, such a stifling atmosphere of cant and artificiality,
as that in which Multatuli spent his childhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>The humour of the Netherlands has, in common with that of
Scotland, a certain canniness and practical shrewdness, characteristic
of men and nations who have bought their experience at
first hand and a heavy price. But, whether for want of that touch
of Celtic fire which in Scotland has leavened the solid Teuton into
a thing quite unique in the world, or what else, there is a notable
lack of that dryness and terseness—that expressing more than the
whole by means of less than the half—which comes out in the best
Scotch anecdotes and sayings. It would be an insult to a listener
of average intelligence, to explain, for example, “It’s a puir shaw
for Kirkintilloch.” We are not sure that—supposing that the
exact equivalent to this joke existed in Dutch—the Netherlander
would feel the insult deeply; we rather think he would enjoy
the story the better for a half page or so of comments in addition
to the full explanation. Of this nature are many jocular
poems by the revered Father Cats, and the “Zinne-poppen” of
Roemer Visscher and his daughter Anna.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Netherlander likes his fun pretty obvious, and not too
concentrated. And the main characteristic of the said fun is its
breadth,—or rather what the Germans call <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Breite</span></i>, for the English
word by no means conveys exactly the same idea. “Long-windedness”
alone does not express it; Coleridge’s “nimiety or
too-muchness” (which he calls a characteristic fault in the
German literary temperament) is much nearer the mark. It is
long-windedness combined with infinite multiplicity of detail,—a
gossipy, good-humoured, complacent triviality, which is the
essence of boredom. Voss’s “Luise” (which poem we doubt
whether any British person now living has read through) is a
shining example of the quality. Nothing is left to the reader’s
imagination—everything, and the reason for everything, is described
and explained at full length, till the best ideas are
swamped in floods of formless verbiage. In Holland, this kind
of writing flourished most extensively in the seventeenth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>eighteenth centuries, and Father Cats, already referred to,
exhibits it in an excessive degree. He also shows an overpowering
desire to be improving,—another point common to the Scot
and the Batavian,—and the two things together made him,
for two centuries, out and out the most popular writer in
Holland.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to “broad” farce, in the other sense of the word, Dutch
literature possesses a good deal of it, of such extreme latitude,
indeed, as to be for the most part entirely unavailable for this
volume. Besides, it is not amusing. The <em>Sotternieën</em>, or farces,
of the Middle Ages, were of an extremely rough and ready type,
to say no more, though Dr Jan Ten Brink accords them the
praise of “accurate observation of Flemish low life, and a real
comic gift.” They mostly turn on matrimonial difficulties, in
which a foolish husband gets the worst of it. More or less of
the same kind, though of a somewhat higher type, were the
farces (<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kluchten</span></i>) of what we may call the Dutch Renaissance
(c. 1550–1650). They mostly turn on rough or even disgusting
practical jokes; they are written in clumsy, lumbering verse,
which has the effect of encouraging and intensifying the author’s
natural diffuseness; in short, whatever laugh-provoking power
they may once have had, most of them are now quite intolerably
dull. The best known are those of Coster, Vos, Jan Starter,
Hooft, Huygens (who made one excursion in this direction—<em>Trijntje
Cornelis</em>), and, above all, Gerbrand Bredero, whose
genius had not yet reached its highest point, when his short and
stormy life came to an end.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gerbrand Adriaenszen Bredero</span> was born at Amsterdam
in 1585. His father was a wealthy tradesman, at first a
shoemaker, and afterwards farmer of the taxes on wines and
spirits. Adriaen Bredero was a generous patron of art, and
intended his son to become a painter; but the latter, though he
studied for a time, and appears to have shown some degree
of talent, preferred to devote himself to literature. He
became a member of the chamber, <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">In Liefde Bloeiende</span></i>,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>and soon formed the acquaintance of Spieghel, the didactic
poet, and the genial Roemer Visscher, the scholarly author of
the “Zinne-poppen” and “Brabbeling.” An unhappy love for
Roemer’s younger daughter, Tesselschade, probably wrecked
his life, the greater part of which was spent in noisy dissipation,
alternating with intervals of deep depression. His work was
both lyric and dramatic; his principal plays are the tragicomedies
of “Roderick and Alphonsus” (1611), “Griane”
(1612), and “The Dumb Knight” (1618), to which may be added
the unfinished play “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het daghet uyt den Oosten</span>,” the farces of
the “Cow” (1612), the “Miller” and “<span lang="fy" xml:lang="fy">Symen sonder Soeticheyt</span>”
(1613), and the regular comedies of “The Moor” (1615), and
“The Spanish Brabanter” (1618). The last-named, his masterpiece,
was intended to satirise (under the name of Jerolimo) the
Chevalier Theodor Rodenburgh, his rival in literature and in a
second unhappy love affair. From this bitter disappointment
Bredero never recovered. He died at the age of thirty-three,
after a lingering illness, tended with devoted care by his mother,
and comforted by the friendship of the gentle and earnesthearted
Vondel, whose religion was of a type to find easier
access to the stormy soul than the gloomy Calvinism of
Bredero’s relations. For further particulars of the poet’s life
the reader is referred to the works of Dr Jan Ten Brink, among
others an interesting historical novel (founded on contemporary
documents) entitled “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De Bredero’s</span>,” which has appeared in
“<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Elsevier’s Geïllustreerd Maandschrift</span>” for 1891 and 1892.
Bredero’s farces are rough, and even coarse—a defect from
which his more elevated work, such as the “Spanish Brabanter,”
is not free; but this is a fault common to the comic literature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>all countries at that epoch. He was no scholar, and though
acquainted with French, did not know Latin, a circumstance for
which his writing is probably none the worse. His comedy,
“Het Moortje” (“The Little Moor”), is an adaptation of a
French version of Terence’s “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eunuchus</span>,” and far inferior to
the “Spanish Brabanter,” which, though not absolutely original
(the plot is to a great extent taken from the Spanish novel
“Lazarillo de Tormes”), is as much so as most of Shakespeare’s,
and full of life and vigour. It is perhaps somewhat verbose, and the
irregular kind of ballad-metre in which it is written lends itself
to indefinite <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">longueurs</span></i>; but the character-painting is excellent.
Indeed, Bredero’s chief merit is the strong human sympathy shown
in his broad, vivid pictures of popular life. He gives us the life of
the street in Amsterdam as he knew it—the beggars, the scolding
wives, the money-lender, the poor gentleman with his frayed
velvet doublet and rapier showing through its worn sheath, the
gossiping sexton, the boys playing at marbles. It is evident
that Bredero was on the right track, and, had he lived, might
have produced even better work than this play,—perhaps founded
a new dramatic school, which might have repeated in Holland
the triumphs of our Elizabethan writers. Dr Ten Brink compares
him in his riotous enjoyment of life and noisy excesses to
Greene, Marlowe, and Massinger. It is difficult to extract any
single scene from the “Spaansche Brabander,” far and away
his best work; and, as, in fact, almost any attempt at translation
could reproduce only the faults of the original, it seemed
better to avoid courting inevitable failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>English influence made itself felt in Holland during the
seventeenth century in more ways than one. Huygens, who
repeatedly visited England, and knew Donne, shows traces of
the “Caroline” manner in his poems and epigrams. Intercourse
between the two countries was frequent, and the connection, of
course, became closer still with their temporary union
under one sovereign. During the eighteenth century, Dutch
literature appeared to be on the wane. Foreign works—English
and French—were admired and read, and educated
persons took a certain pride in neglecting their native language
as a barbarous and uncultivated tongue. It was in a passionate
impulse of patriotism that Mevrouw Betje Wolff and Mejuffrouw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Aagje Deken determined to enter into competition with the
universally popular Richardson, and prove to the reading public
of Holland that a Dutch novel, showing Dutch characters amid
the everyday surroundings of Amsterdam, Utrecht, or the
Hague, might be quite as interesting as any foreign importation.
The result was the publication, in 1782, of the “History of
Mejuffrouw Sara Burgerhart,” which ran into a third edition in
1786.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Elizabeth Wolff</span> and <span class='sc'>Agatha Deken</span> were two friends,
affectionately spoken of by their compatriots as Betje and Aagje,
who lived and wrote together, and collaborated so harmoniously
that it is impossible to distinguish their respective shares in
the works jointly issued by them. Elizabeth Bekker, born
at Flushing, July 24, 1738, is described as “a little delicate
woman, with penetrating dark eyes, twinkling with humorous
mischief.” Her lively spirit maintained a hard struggle against
the harsh old-fashioned Calvinism of her Zeeland home, as
represented by her elder brother Laurens. It was probably to
escape from this that, at twenty, she married a “dominie” of
fifty-two—the Predikant Adriaen Wolff. In the quiet of the
country parsonage she lived, happily enough, from 1759 to 1777,
devoted to her elderly husband, and with abundant leisure for
literature. During this period she wrote chiefly in verse, and
published several collections of poems; but, when left a widow
in 1777, she invited her friend Agatha Deken to live with her.
Agatha, three years younger than her friend, was an orphan,
brought up in the Amsterdam “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Weeshuis</span>,” who had been living
as companion with an invalid lady named Maria Bosch, also
given to poetry. The two friends first essayed themselves in
prose, by publishing “Letters on Various Subjects,” in 1780,
after which they gradually developed the idea of a novel in
letters, after the manner of Richardson. “The History of
Mejuffrouw Sara Burgerhart,” in spite of its somewhat repellent
epistolary form, remains capital reading to the present day. The
book is not so very long-winded, considering the epoch at which
it was written; the characters are clearly conceived and sympathetically
drawn; and there is a delicate humour which might
almost be compared with Jane Austen’s, but has a distinct flavour
of its own. The portraiture of Sara’s aunt, Mejuffrouw Hofland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>and the designing parasites who make her their prey—Cornelia
Slimpslamp, and Brother Benjamin, the butcher’s man turned
preacher—reminds us of Betje Bekker’s bitterness against the
fanatical precisians (called by themselves “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vromen</span>,” or pious,
and by others “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">fijnen</span>,” or subtle) who had darkened her youth.
“Sara Burgerhart,” published in 1782, was followed by a longer
work, “Historie van den Heer Willem Leevend,” which in some
respects surpasses it. In 1788 the friends left Holland, in consequence
of political changes, and settled at Trevoux in Burgundy,
where they remained till 1795, writing “Letters of
Abraham Blankaart,” and their third novel, “Cornelia Wildschut.”
Betje was robbed of her small property by a rascally
man of business; and, at the time of the Terror, narrowly
escaped the guillotine, being looked on as an aristocrat by the
republicans of Trevoux. They returned to Holland in 1795,
settled at the Hague, and set themselves to translating for a bare
living. Their last years were spent amid great financial difficulties
and privations, borne with their usual cheerfulness, and
one cherished wish was granted them at last,—Betje died
November 5, 1804, and Aagje only survived her nine days.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a pity that these books are not of a kind to show
to advantage in extracts. To be appreciated, they must be
taken in bulk, as the character-drawing, which is their chief
attraction, only comes out indirectly, and point by point, in the
course of the letters. Which of the two collaborators should be
credited with the quiet humour—of the type recognised as
peculiarly feminine—which flashes through them, is a disputed
point, but it is usually attributed to Betje Wolff. Internal
evidence, and especially the history of her early life, seem
to point to her as having originated the character of Sara
herself, the bright, lovable, merry-hearted girl, so willing to
submit to loving guidance, but impatient of the gloomy restraint
of Aunt Susanna’s house, which called out all that was worst
in her nature. Agatha Deken, we are told, was a large, fair
person, of calm aspect and portly presence—somewhat prosaic
and matter-of-fact—yet the description does not exclude the
possibility of a certain “pawkiness,”—and probably there is no
hard and fast distinction to be drawn between the two, as regards
the humorous element. And, however that may be, “Sara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>Burgerhart” is a charming book, and deserves to be much more
widely known than it is. Lovers of “Evelina” would delight in
its old-time quaintness, and even those without an especial
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti-pris</span></i> for the eighteenth century could not fail to appreciate
the delicately finished pictures of Dutch life. Some points in
this latter suggest the question whether many things which we
have been accustomed to consider as purely American manners
did not originate in the Dutch ancestry of the New-Yorkers.
The comings and goings of the young ladies at the Amsterdam
boarding-house, under the friendly (but to contemporary English
notions very inadequate) supervision of the Widow Spilgoed,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</span></i> Buigzaam, is one of those. Others suggest themselves to an
attentive reader of the book. But this is only in passing.
Decidedly, an English version of “Sara” with a loving and
appreciative introduction by a capable hand, would be an
addition to the pleasures of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is no part of the plan of this brief sketch—which aims
throughout at being suggestive rather than exhaustive—to
furnish a comprehensive introduction to Dutch literature, or
even to that part of it to which these pages are exclusively
devoted. There is one point, however, which we must not overlook.
This is not the place—and perhaps, indeed, the time has
not fully come—to discuss the position which Multatuli holds,
or ought to hold, in his country’s literature; but it cannot fail
to strike any reader of this volume, that a large—perhaps disproportionately
large—number of pages is assigned to the work
of a writer cast in as un-Dutch, or even anti-Dutch, a mould as
it is possible to imagine. In fact, Multatuli stands as much
alone among the Dutch, as Heine does among the Germans;
and, by the same token, we might add, he is their only real
humorist, in the highest sense. This apartness is not to be
accounted for in Douwes Dekker’s case, by difference of race;
but then, he was partly the product of reaction, and there were,
after all, strong race-affinities in the deeper parts of his character.
He had every quality calculated to jar upon the feelings of the
Amsterdam <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits bourgeois</span></i> of his day: he had other ideals
than theirs; he would not be content to make money and
abstain from shocking the neighbours; he was nervous and
imaginative in a stolid and prosaic generation—lavishly extravagant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>in a prudent, not to say parsimonious, one; but his
passionate love of freedom, his intolerance of shams, his resolute
refusal to utter the shibboleths of the age or bow before the idols
of the market-place, proved him of one blood with William of
Orange and Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde. And, had he been
as altogether isolated as he seems at first sight, he could hardly
have become the force in national life that he now is. His “Max
Havelaar” was like a volcanic outburst breaking up the crust
of convention which had been slowly stiffening over Holland;
but it gave voice to a cry which had been stifled in thousands
of hearts. He spoke, and the younger generation answered him
as one man. To-day, in Holland, Multatuli is a name to conjure
with—a synonym for life, thought, progress, revolt against convention—for
everything that may be called modernity.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a crude, formless, unmethodical writer. “Max
Havelaar” is one of the most exasperatingly inartistic books
ever written, and it must always remain matter for regret that
he never seriously took in hand to complete and give artistic
unity to the brilliant fragments that form the unfinished history
of “Woutertje Pieterse.” But there is life and red blood in
everything he wrote—and that counts for far more than dead
correctness of form,—though, of course, the perfect form <em>enshrining</em>
the vitality gives it a chance to last longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is something in “Wouter” that reminds one curiously of
the “Story of an African Farm.” Not that we would infer that
the latter was suggested by the former—it may well be that its
author was, at the time, quite unaware of Multatuli’s existence;
and the agonies of isolated childhood are the same all the world
over. But there are certain points of resemblance which make
us think that a similar environment—the compound of dead
Calvinism, Dutch pseudo-propriety, and crass ignorance—produced
similar results. Though, perhaps it was natural that poor
Wouter, dreaming on the bridge by the saw-mill at Amsterdam,
should have less lofty visions than Waldo, dreaming on the
open veldt under the stars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wouter began his career in the story with a crime. He
wanted very much to read a book in the circulating library, but
he had not the necessary twopence. His mother thought little
boys had no use for pocket-money. Besides, circulating libraries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>did not enter into Juffrouw Pieterse’s calculations from any point
of view. But it was so deadly dull at home, where there were
no interesting books left unread—and no one was supposed to
want to read at all, except Stoffel, the elder brother, who was a
pupil-teacher, and preparing for an examination,—and he did
long, with an unspeakable longing, for the “History of Glorioso
the Brigand.” So he sold his Bible, with the paraphrases at the
end, to a book-stall man on the Old Bridge (this particular is
never forgotten in subsequent references to the misdemeanour,
as though it had been an aggravation thereof), trusting to the
fact that the volume was not likely to be inquired after on a
week-day, to escape scot-free till Sunday. Which he did; but
with Sunday came discovery and swift retribution. But Wouter
did not mind that,—he had had his “Glorioso,” and was willing
to pay the price. That was not all, however;—this piece of juvenile
depravity had far-reaching consequences; but what they were
will be discovered from the extracts given in the text.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is infinite humour, as well as infinite pathos, in the
description of the poor, starved child-soul, to which even a
trashy sensational novel could give some sort of outlook into the
ideal—for that was what Wouter’s (after all very innocent)
glorification of crime practically amounted to. No better proof
of the hold which Multatuli has over the hearts of his countrymen
could be given than the fact that many of his characters
have passed into proverbs. Juffrouw Laps, Dominie Pennewip,
the Hallemans,—“who were so very particularly respectable,”—and
others, are constantly to be met with in current literature.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet, curiously enough, his views are almost entirely
negative. He is a preacher of revolt—a revolt often blind,
illogical, inconsistent with itself, and which, from our point of
view, seems curiously out of date—so that one is apt to forget
he has only been dead six years,—and he is seldom, if ever, a
teacher of anything else. It proves how greatly the revolt was
needed, and what was the power of that Dagon of convention
against which he directed his blows.</p>

<p class='c009'>One word about the drama<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> from which an extract has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>given. It was one of his earliest works, being written at Padang
(Sumatra) in 1843, when he was little more than a youth; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>he himself in later years, was sarcastic enough at the expense of its
“lachrymose sentiment” and emotional idealism. Perhaps it does
err by excess in this direction, especially in Holm’s interminable
monologues,—perhaps, also, the comic scenes force the note a
little, and are not free from the trick of catch-words,—but the
play, as a whole, is a capital one, and was, we believe, very
successful on the stage. He wrote another serious drama, in
verse, the “Vorstenschool,” which has never been acted, but
perhaps for political rather than dramatic reasons. It seems a
pity that he did not make more sustained efforts in this style of
writing, which would have chastened the formlessness above
alluded to as marring his work; but he seems to have been too
impatient in getting his thoughts on paper to submit to the
necessary restraints.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be noticed that this selection includes specimens from
both Dutch and Belgian writers. The fact is that Belgium,
from a literary point of view, scarcely exists. The written language
is the same for both countries, the differences being mainly
local and dialectical. After Brabant and Flanders had ceased
to be Spanish provinces, and prior to the Revolution of 1830,
the two portions were respectively known as Noord and Zuid
Nederland. After 1830, the national language was, for a time,
entirely discredited, and Belgium threatened to become a mere
imitation of France, if not actually an appendage to that country.
Of late years a reaction has set in. A knowledge of Flemish
is required by law of all Government officials, except in those
districts exclusively inhabited by the Walloons, who are supposed
to speak French, though in fact, they discourse in a
tongue which no mortal but themselves can understand.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is an increasing number of Flemish papers,—the comic
ones especially doing valiant service on the national side. In
1883 a law was passed rendering the teaching of Flemish (or
“Netherlands,” as both Dutch and Belgians prefer to call it)
obligatory in all intermediate schools. At Ghent University,
moreover, all lectures are now delivered in that language, as
well as some of the courses at the Universities of Brussels and
Louvain. Straws show which way the wind blows; and, though
a trifle, it is a significant one, that the streets of Antwerp are
now labelled in Flemish, as well as French, and that public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>notices, advertisements, &amp;c., when not bi-lingual, are usually
Flemish.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time of this linguistic reaction has also been one of
revival in the national literature. Maeterlinck, it is true, writes
in French; and a small coterie of less-known writers, calling
themselves <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Jeune Belgique</span></i>, have chosen that language as the
vehicle of their inspirations; but these do not represent the
main current of the national life. For a long time, Conscience
stood almost alone as a Flemish writer, and he was only known
to the outer world through the medium of French translations.
Now we have, of poets, Pol de Mont, De la Montagne, Hilda
Ram, and Hélene Swarth, who, had she written in a more
widely known language, would be recognised as one of the
world’s greatest lyrists;—of prose-writers, Stijns, Virginie Loveling,
Segers, Smits, Van Cuyck, Anton Moortgat, Emile Seipgens,
and many others. Not all of them are available for our present
purpose,—but some, as will be seen, have been selected from.</p>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion, I would express my indebtedness for valuable
information kindly given by Mr Frans Van Cuyck, of the Public
Library, Antwerp, and author of “Twee Huwelijken,” “Sinoren,”
and other works.</p>

<p>“I STROLLED THOUGHTFULLY ALONG THE BEACH.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><em>King Bilbonzo</em>. It is well. We ourself now desire to make
an important communication to you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Palaemon</em> (<em>Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Kingdom</em>).
We are all attention.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> It pleased us to have a very strange dream
last night.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Courtiers.</em> Aha!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> I dreamed, gentlemen, that I was on an
island in the midst of the ocean. My royal palace, surrounded
by luxuriant gardens, stood in the centre of the
island. My whole retinue was assembled there,—they were
all laughing, dancing, and feasting. On all sides, smiling
faces, rustling silks, and waves of sweet dance-music. Meanwhile,
I strolled thoughtfully along the beach, reflected on
the bounties of nature, and picked up shells.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Courtiers.</em> Ah!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> But suddenly the ground trembled under
my feet. I looked up, and perceived that the whole island
was moving under me. It heaved, rocked this way and
that, rose and fell on the water, and, finally, shot swiftly over
the surface of the foaming sea. The beautiful island, my
lords and gentlemen, was a living, terrible sea-monster!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Courtiers</em> (<em>in horror</em>). Ah!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> My courtiers clung to me in terror. My
head swam. Suddenly the monster dived, and the sea at once
destroyed the palace and gardens. I myself, with a few
faithful ones—you, my lords, among the number—remained
bobbing up and down, holding to an empty cask. But the
monster came once more to the surface, lifted a huge
dripping mouth out of the water, and swallowed us all.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Courtiers.</em> B-r-r-r!—most horrible!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> However, after a short interval of
oppressive darkness, it cast us out again uninjured—and I
found myself in my bed!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Courtiers</em> (<em>drawing a long breath of relief</em>). Eh!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> What is your opinion, my lords? Is this
a prophetic vision?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Palaemon.</em> It is a fact that the prophet Jonah, some time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>since, had the honour of experiencing something very like
what your Majesty has just dreamed.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> Does any of you think himself in a position
to explain this dream to me? [<em>All shake their heads.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Palaemon.</em> Sire, I have been told that there is, at this
moment, a Spanish magician staying in our capital. Perhaps
he might be able to comply with your wish. I have already
given orders to have this person searched for—probably he
has already reached the palace....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> Why! this is exceedingly interesting!
Be so good as to bring the man into our presence at once.</p>

<div class='c012'>[<em>Exit Palaemon.</em></div>

</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Palaemon.</em> Here is the man.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> Come nearer, my friend.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Don Torribio.</em> Who told you that I am your friend? Are
you in the thought-reading business too?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Homaris</em> (<em>3<sup>rd</sup> Minister</em>). This is an unmannerly customer.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Palaemon.</em> Do you know you are speaking to the King?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Don Torribio.</em> Why, yes,—I thought so. I presume no
one else would wear such a head-gear.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> Silence, my lords!—this is evidently an
eccentric man. Let him alone. Magicians, fools, and poets
have ever been allowed a certain familiarity with princes.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Don Torribio.</em> You forget to add <em>fleas</em>, my prince.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ministers.</em> Hush!—shame!—shame!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> Decency! decency!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Don Torribio.</em> I assure you they are very decent well-behaved
little beasts, O King. They have never bitten you
in your absence! They are the most honest of your subjects.
They have never taken anything from you without informing
you of the fact. There are not many like that. And they are not
at present suffering from hunger. Not many like that either.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo</em>. Silence, now! Do you know wherefore
you have been summoned hither?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span><em>Don Torribio.</em> Certainly. We are going to act a little play
together. You are Nebuchadnezzar, and I am Daniel.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo</em> (<em>to Palaemon</em>). I see your Excellency has
already enlightened him.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Palaemon.</em> Certainly not, your Majesty.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> Ah! this is indeed surprising. Listen
then, and I will tell you my dream.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Don Torribio.</em> No, no—you need not let me off any of
my part. I mean to play Daniel entire—but I am not going
to let you off the grass-eating, either! Do you listen to me,
and I will interpret the dream.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> Well—this is astonishing!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Ministers.</em> Think of that, now!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Homaris.</em> All pre-concerted!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Don Torribio.</em> Gathering shells is an innocent and even
laudable employment,—but it should be carried on on a safe
shore, and not within reach of hungry sea-monsters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every man—and more especially a king—ought to know
what his house is built on.</p>

<p class='c009'>If your house happens to stand—not on a rock foundation,
but on the back of a sleeping whale, you must not dance too
vigorously, or you will probably wake the brute.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is safer to swim about in the sea on the back of a shark,
than to be king of a famished people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conclusion of your dream I will interpret to you
after the grass-eating. Now it is your turn.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>King Bilbonzo.</em> This is really going too far! Our
toleration has reached its limits. Can you be wanting to
sow discord between Us and our beloved people? Out of
our sight, impious liar!—this very moment!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Hyacinthe</em> (<em>the Poet-Laureate—seated next to the King</em>).

<p class='c009'><em>Homaris.</em> I had feared as much, Sire! He is a clever
quack, and what he sells is poison for the people.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Lepidus.</em> But his knowledge was something wonderful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a very serious matter,” said Gerrit Rond, the burgomaster,

<p class='c009'>“Very serious, indeed,” replied Kobus, the <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">veldwachter</span></i>.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a disgrace to the whole parish!” continued the

<p class='c009'>“An everlasting disgrace!” repeated the veldwachter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then followed an ominous silence, in the course of

waistcoat; while the veldwachter kept a watchful eye on his

<p class='c009'>At length the reverend head of Gerrit, the burgomaster,
solemnly rose upright, and his reflection opposite did the
same.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kobus,” said Gerrit, “it <em>must</em> be seen to.”</p>

satisfied way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha!” cried Kobus, triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, surely,&nbsp;... surely,&nbsp;...” said Gerrit, as though
thinking aloud,—still, astute, smiling, and rubbing his
nose,&nbsp;... “But let us at least go over the whole thing once
more—at least the main point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall I tell your worship once more, exactly?” asked
Kobus, with a self-satisfied laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes, it will be just as well. I can then weigh the
importance of the whole matter so much better. Just go
on,” said the burgomaster, with the lofty attitude of one who
is quite sure of himself, and can afford to wait for anything,
seeing that his resolution is already taken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will therefore tell your worship, once more,” began
Kobus, “that on Saturday week—a fortnight ago to-morrow—Jan
o’ the Wood came running into my house with a face—with
a face....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like Balthasar Gerard’s,”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> the burgomaster helped him
out, with a certain gloomy majesty befitting the dignity of
his position and his historical knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That would be just about it,” said Kobus, with deep
respect, and then went on. “He rushed into my house
with a face like—h’m, h’m—it’s sinful to think of—what a
face the man had! And first he dropped down on a chair,
and couldn’t speak a word—not a letter—your worship! My
wife gave him a glass of water, and she said, says she,
‘Come, Jan, just drink a little, and then you’ll come to
yourself again, and then you can tell us what’s the matter.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>That’s what she said, your worship,—for them women-folk
are always so curious, and she was just on fire, I tell you.
Jan soon got his breath, and then it came out—how, that
night—last Saturday week, a fortnight ago to-morrow—two
baskets full of pears had been taken away from his trees—two
whole baskets, your worship!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerrit Rond, the burgomaster, the principal resident,
and the respected head of his parish, stroked his plump
chin complacently, and looked at his factotum, quietly
smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well; and what more, Kobus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such imperturbable calm must surely conceal a great
plan, thought the veldwachter; and he was several seconds
recovering from his consternation. Then he stammered,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“And&nbsp;... and&nbsp;... nothing more, your worship. I
reported the matter to you at once; I drew up the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</span></i>. But though I have done my best to find out....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The honest veldwachter completed his sentence by
shrugging his shoulders, extending his arms, and dropping
them again,—illustrating the whole pantomime by a face
expressive of the utmost helplessness.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now Gerrit Rond, burgomaster, the principal resident,
and respected head of the community, arose from his
municipal arm-chair, and spake,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kobus, I know it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kobus listened in breathless excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kobus,” the burgomaster went on, looking round him
with vigilant eyes, as though he suspected that pear-thieves
might be hidden in the corners of his sitting-room,—“Kobus,
did he steal <em>all</em> the pears?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The veldwachter was silent, and looked questioningly at
the burgomaster. He could not make out what the latter
was driving at.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean,” explained the father of the citizens, “whether
Jan o’ the Wood has not got a single pear left on his trees?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Well; no, sir. Two baskets the rascal made off with;
but how many baskets there were to be had in that orchard,
I don’t know. It’s quite terrible the way Jan’s trees bear,
and everything prime quality, large-sized, and juicy. I
think Jan’s father had them before him, and he must have
brought them....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will do, Kobus,” the burgomaster interrupted his
subordinate; “but that’s not the point.... So the pears
have not <em>all</em> been removed? I mean, by this, that the
thief has not unlawfully possessed himself of the <em>whole?</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no, your worship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Kobus, look here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kobus listened respectfully, understanding that the critical
moment had now arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My father, Kobus, was a man of sense, and when he
had enjoyed anything, he always used to say, ‘This peach
tastes of more.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Kobus, as though suddenly enlightened,—whereas,
in truth, he was more puzzled than
ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, look you, Kobus, the apple can never fall far from
the tree. My father was a sensible man; and I, too, say,
‘This peach tastes of more,’ and....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the burgomaster looked through his half-closed
eyelids with an air of infinite sagacity, and added, slowly
dragging out his words, one by one,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“... And—that—I suspect—the thief—will—say—too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O-o-oh!” bellowed the veldwachter; “I understand—the
thief will want more pears. He will come back, and
then we’ll catch him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The burgomaster looked at his factotum with a paternal
air of approbation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kobus!” said he, “something may be made of you yet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does your worship think that?” cried Kobus, in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>ecstasy,—and a rosy prospect instantly appeared before his
mind’s eye—chief agent in a large town, commissioner of
police, nay, perhaps,—but that he would not have dared to
say out loud for any money in the world,—perhaps, one day,
even burgomaster!</p>

<p class='c009'>“But now to business, Kobus! This very night we will
try to catch the thief; and my name is not Gerrit Rond if
we don’t succeed. We’ll hide in Jan’s orchard, and when he
comes we’ll collar him, and then....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the burgomaster-detective pointed downwards. Under
the tower of the court-house there was a vault or cellar of
masonry, which usually served as a receptacle for old iron and
thieves; the latter destination, however, was unknown, save by
tradition, for only the very oldest inhabitants of the village
dimly remembered an evil-doer being imprisoned there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kobus then suggested that it might be as well to take his
son Hannes with him on their expedition, a suggestion which
might have been unkindly interpreted by outsiders, for there
were unpleasant reports current about the brave <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garde-champêtre’s</span></i>
reluctance to pursue criminals alone. The suggestion,
however, found favour in the eyes of the magistrate, as it
would enable them to take forty winks while the boy watched
for the appearance of the thief. This being settled, Kobus
withdrew, to reappear at the appointed time that evening.
But he had not been gone long when a loud knocking startled
the burgomaster out of an incipient reverie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in!” he cried, somewhat ungraciously, and the
opening door revealed Kobus’s bearded face; but this time
with so scared an expression, and such wildly rolling eyes, that
Gerrit turned rigid with terror and, pale as death, held on to
the back of his chair for support, as he stammered,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wh—wh—what is it, Kobus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Burrgemeesterr</em>,” rolled out Kobus, hoarsely, making as
much as possible of the <em>r’s</em>, and putting his head round the
door without coming into the room, “the thief of the apples
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>that were stolen from Piet Stein a year and a half ago, and
this thief of the pears....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same,” sighed the burgomaster, struck with consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your worship,” said Kobus, “it is a conspiracy! Shall
we—should we—go and ask the Dominie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But scarcely had Kobus uttered this fatal word than he
darted out of the door and up the street, and it was long
before his mind’s eye had lost sight of that frightful picture:
the burgomaster, purple in the face, and boiling over with
indignation; and the voice of his superior thundered in his
ears with all the annihilating force of contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Dominie!” was all he had said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The village schoolmaster was an old man of sixty-three,
who, ever since his twentieth year, had stood, day after
day, Sundays excepted, behind the same desk, leading the
peasants’ children from the spelling of s, p, a—spa, to the
four elementary rules of arithmetic. Every year a few left
him, being found ripe for forgetting at the plough-tail what
they had learnt in the schoolroom, and every year fresh
aspirants for s, p, a—spa, appeared on the scenes. So he
had grown old at his work, and his work with him. For he
belonged to the pre-examination days—he was a “<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schoolmeester</span></i>,”
not an “<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">onderwijzer</span></i>.” The new generation looked
on him rather as a curiosity, a touchstone of progress, a
souvenir of old times, than a living being, a wheel in the
world-machine of the nineteenth century. Other men of
his age had gone with the stream, and followed its capricious
windings; he had landed on the bank, and followed his own
old path; his mind had rusted into the old groove, and he
could not extricate it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had already received hints that he ought to retire, to
ask for his pension, so as to make way for modern forces; but
the idea of ceasing to stand before his class and behind his
desk was too strange to the old man—too new!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>So he remained on for the present, till his resignation
should no longer be a matter of choice.</p>

<p class='c011'>The elder children were busy doing sums; the younger
ones were being attended to by the Dominie himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>But how strange he was to-day! It sometimes seemed as
if he heard nothing of the lesson the children were droning
over,—saw nothing of the tricks the older ones were up to
in the background,—as if, in fact, he were thinking of something
entirely different. He had such fits, sometimes.
How funny it was, now, when he dipped his pencil into
the inkstand, instead of a penholder, and, shortly afterwards,
abstractedly put it into his mouth! What a face he made
when he found it out! The whole school had simply yelled
at the joke, and the Dominie had got very angry, and put
the whole lot of them in detention. Later, however, he
almost laughed at the matter himself, and allowed them all
to go home. Such foolish and absurd things he used to do
every now and then; and the reason for this was, as the
burgomaster said, because the Dominie was “an obstructive
fellow,” and “not practical.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when the burgomaster said so, every one believed
him, for the burgomaster was considered a very clever man.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, after all, the Dominie was cleverer still.</p>

<p class='c009'>For, indeed, there were sometimes things that the Dominie
himself did not know,—of course, for no man can know everything.
But, in those cases, he always said, “I’ll just look it
up.” And then he looked in his books, and kept on looking
till he found it; and he always did find it, because he had
such piles of books! For, after all, that was where things
were to be found—in books! For this reason the burgomaster
was not so clever as the schoolmaster; he had scarcely
any books at all. This was one cause of the burgomaster’s
dislike. He was Gerrit Rond, <em>the burgomaster</em>, the first man
in the village; and the Dominie was just the schoolmaster.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>And, naturally, the former could not endure being looked on
as less clever than the latter. But he did not utter this
opinion aloud; he sometimes needed the Dominie’s help in
“just looking up something,” and swallowed his dislike as
best he could; but people could see it all the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, indeed! the Dominie was particularly clever!</p>

<p class='c009'>Once it befell that Piet Stein’s son came home from the
city, where he had “studied” with a view to becoming
assistant-teacher; and on that occasion he had said, in the
presence of his father, “All the Dominie’s cleverness is worth
nothing; he is antiquated, and doesn’t know French.” Piet
Stein, junior, was well acquainted with the French language;
he had just learnt it. But Piet Stein, senior, seized his promising
son by the collar, and dealt him a well-intentioned
thrashing, “to knock these new-fangled notions out of him
once for all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the schoolmaster was a knowledgeable man. He lived
with his books, and—which was less obvious to the eyes of
the world—with his instruments and his medicine-chest.
For years past he had been practising on his own account,
and had acquired a certain medical reputation among the
peasants of the neighbourhood as well as within the village.
He had, in truth, treated several cases within the last few
years with great success; but it might be better not to
inquire how many earlier trials had failed. Then came the
new ideas—the laws against unlicensed doctoring were strictly
enforced, and he received warnings from various quarters, of
which, however, he took no notice. He could not understand
why he might not try to lessen people’s sufferings, as
well as other men, who usually did not succeed any better
than he. It had become to him a passion, an aim in life,
a vocation.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he obstinately went his own way, in spite of warnings,
till the doctors, whom he injured in their practice, at last lost
patience, and prosecuted him. He was convicted and fined,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and from that time his medical career was over,—at least so
it was universally reported. It seemed strange, however, that
now and then a sick person made a wonderful recovery,
without having been treated by the doctor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, one evening it happened that old Klaas, the shepherd,
was seriously ill, and had asked for the schoolmaster.
The Dominie had said “No,” but he had meant “Yes”; for
though no longer allowed to do any doctoring, he could not
keep from it. So he meant to wait till it was dark, and then
slip out unnoticed to Klaas’ cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Jan o’ the Wood’s orchard three figures were crouching
down behind three low dwarf pear-trees, and each of the
three had his head full of thoughts that were not those of his
neighbour. The burgomaster was chiefly tortured by the
idea that on the good or ill success of the evening’s undertaking
depended the preservation of his official dignity; for,
seeing that he had enjoined the strictest secrecy on the
veldwachter, and his promising son and heir, the only question
was which of the two would most speedily spread abroad
the whole story through the village. But, over and above
this, the respected head of the community was trembling like
an aspen-leaf, for before his mental eye there arose a vision
of a robber—yes, truly and literally, <em>a robber</em>,—a man with a
long beard, bristling hair, and bloodshot eyes,—a man who
goes about with jemmies and murderous weapons on his
person, and—and—who might kill you if you came in his
way, you see!</p>

<p class='c009'>The veldwachter was, before all things, eager to behold the
heroic feats of the burgomaster, for he was firmly convinced
that the mere presence of the great man was sufficient to
compel the miscreant to run into the snare. For terror there
was <em>now</em> no room in his martial spirit,—for, after all, he had
Hannes with him!</p>

<p class='c009'>Hannes was a big sturdy chap, who at fifteen might well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>have been taken for eighteen,—a fellow with fists like engine-buffers,
and a face which, for shrewd intelligence of expression,
was about equal to that of a sheep. Hannes was
burning with impatience to hammer away at the malefactor;
hitherto he had only tried his strength on mere vagabonds,
but now he was to have the opportunity of measuring
himself with a real thief. That would be something to
boast of!</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the three would-be thief-catchers sat in the greatest
excitement behind three of the smallest dwarf pear-trees that
any one can imagine.</p>

<p class='c009'>A considerable time elapsed, during which even the
strained senses of the triumvirate could perceive nothing
which, in the remotest degree, resembled even a fraction of a
thief. At last Hannes’ patience was exhausted, and with it
his capacity for silence. “Dad,” he began in a whisper, “if
he comes, am I to take him by the throat and choke him,
or shall I punch his head till he falls down dead?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” replied the veldwachter, in an equally
cautious whisper, at least as low as his love for gutturals and
sibilants would allow, “I’ll just ask his worship.” Thus did
Kobus, and repeated the gruesome question to the burgomaster,
thereby sending a shudder through the latter’s limbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him,” said the heroic man to his heroic subordinate,
who was squatting between his superior and his son, “that
he must seize him by the legs, so as not to come within
reach of his hands; the thief is sure to have daggers and
pistols to defend himself with if he is attacked.” Thus spake
the wise man; but the real reason for his caution was that he
felt there might be disagreeable consequences for himself if
Hannes received the thief in too heavy-handed a manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The veldwachter passed on the message in a whisper to
his son:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold him by the legs, Hannes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, dad,” replied Hannes, though he did not understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>why he was to treat the criminal so gently. But the
burgomaster had said so,—in other words, the oracle had
spoken, and so——</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very quiet, in the dark, behind Jan’s pear-tree.
The burgomaster dropped his venerated head, and slept.
When Kobus heard the low sound of snoring beside him, he
turned to his son, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hannes, his worship is off; I think I’ll have a nap too;
keep a good look-out, and give me a push if you see anything
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, dad,” said Hannes, and he sat bolt upright,
and opened his eyes still wider than before. But the duet at
his side, the darkness all round him, and the weariness in his
eyelids, made him close them now and then. He struggled
bravely against sleep, but there was no one to help him.
And he was only fifteen, and it was so late and so dark, and
Hannes fell into a doze.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now and then he was awakened for a moment or so by
the uneasy thought that he was the one who had to watch.
On one of these occasions, he thought he saw a dim figure
pass right before him in this dark, and to hear steps—hurried
footsteps. He rubbed his eyes, and—yes—there was some
one carefully opening the gate and leaving the orchard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hastily Hannes awakened his parent, in the gentle manner
prescribed and told him, in a whisper, what he knew. The
awful tidings were then reported to the burgomaster, and
a moment later the trio were on their way to seek the thief,
who surely, as the veldwachter supposed, was just carrying
away his booty. Hannes went first, the burgomaster
followed, and Kobus formed the rearguard. This order had
been determined by the burgomaster. “For,” said he, “as
head of the community, I ought to have the most protection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In this way the police force wandered aimlessly about for
some time. Hannes did not know for certain what direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the thief had taken after leaving the orchard; and, besides,
there was scarcely any light. It really seemed as though
the moon were taking upon herself to play at bo-peep with
the most worshipful the burgomaster, for she chose not to
show up at all. Yes, perhaps, indeed—oh! scandalous
thought!—she was making faces at the great man behind her
thick curtain of clouds! Who knows?—there are such queer
stories told about the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The expedition, then, returned to the orchard unsuccessful,
and once more took up its position behind the dwarf
pear-trees. That the miscreant might yet return seemed
probable, as Hannes assured them that he had indeed seen
him carrying something under his arm, but not a large sack
or anything of that sort. He could not, therefore, have taken
<em>much</em> with him. And they waited—waited—waited....</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the schoolmaster had quietly gone on his way.
The better to escape observation, he did not take the nearest
way, along the main street, but went out into his back
garden, opened a little gate which led into Jan o’ the Wood’s
orchard, struck right across the orchard, and so reached
a lane leading round to the other side of the village. Here
he turned into a wood, and, following a small winding footpath,
came at length to a lonely cottage, seemingly forsaken,
hidden away among the tall trees. Here he seemed a
habitual visitor. At least he lifted the latch without first
knocking, opened the door, and found himself in an apartment
serving at the same time as bedroom and kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>A close, heavy air, and an ominous stillness, seemed to
oppress him as he entered. But the Dominie was not
easily daunted. He felt about till he found a lamp standing
on the table, and lit it. With the light, life seemed to come
into the dead silence of the room; at least a low moaning
was heard from a corner where there was a bedstead, and a
broken voice asked, “Who’s there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s I, Klaas, the schoolmaster,” announced the visitor;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and, bending over the sick man, he went on, “How is it
with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all up, Dominie, it’s all up,” gasped the voice. “Oh,
Klaas is no great loss—not much; oh no!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There seemed to be reason enough for such an estimate;
at least the man who lay there dying did not give the idea
of one whose loss society would feel very keenly. The
flickering lamp-light showed the bed-place, let into the wall
like a ship’s berth, in an indefinite half-darkness, except
the head, on which a dull yellow gleam was cast. There
lay, on an unsightly grey, greasy bolster, a head that at first
sight seemed more animal than human. The thin face was
made still more angular and hollow by the strongly projecting
cheek-bones, and the pointed chin with its bristly beard.
The upper-lip, and indeed the whole mouth, was almost
covered with stiff hair; the nose was broad, flat, and turned
up; while a quantity of lank, tangled hair fell over the projecting
forehead and deep-set eyes. But these eyes glittered
fiercely, every now and then, in their dark sockets, and
then again looked anxiously, almost entreatingly, at the
schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Dominie tried to answer him cheerfully. “Come,
come, Klaas! What foolish talk is this? You may not
have been a king or a great man, but you have been of
use for all that. Shepherds are wanted just as much as
kings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir,” said Klaas, moving his head restlessly.
“Every day so many finer lights are blown out, and Klaas
is only a rushlight. Oh, Lord, yes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old schoolmaster tried to comfort him, but Klaas
still seemed to have something on his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had stolen Jan’s pears a fortnight ago, he told the
schoolmaster at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man remained with him till a late hour, and then
started homewards by the same way as he had come.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Father, father!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Hannes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hear the gate creak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So it does.... Your worship, here he comes back
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really? Yes, I see him.... Kobus, stand firm, my
man. Let Hannes hold him fast by the legs. No, not yet—wait
till he passes! Oh, do be careful! Look out for his
weapons!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hannes, be ready!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m quite ready, dad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not before I speak, and then by the legs—do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dad. Hush now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>—The shuffling of approaching footsteps in the grass of
the orchard&nbsp;... suddenly a figure disengages itself from
the darkness.—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Hannes, now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hannes creeps forward along the ground, seizes the figure,
according to instructions, firmly by the ankles—a good pull—and
the thief falls forward at full length. Hannes seizes
his wrists, and lets himself fall flat on the top of his prey.</p>

<p class='c009'>The veldwachter, for greater security, incontinently throws
himself upon his two predecessors; and the burgomaster
crowns the human pyramid, and the successful thief-hunt, by
sitting down, with all his burgomasterly weight and a heavy
bump, upon the three others, triumphantly shouting the
while, “I’ve got him,”—which is answered by, “Oh my ribs,
your worship!” from the uppermost stratum, “What in
thunder!” from the midmost, and a smothered groan from
the lowest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hannes, have you got a hold of his hands—tight now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, your worship, but I can’t do anything myself like
this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll get up, but keep a good hold of him—do you
hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The burgomaster arose. “Kobus, put the handcuffs on
him at once. In heaven’s name make haste about it then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The veldwachter bustled up from the ground, and set
about securing the prisoner as closely as possible. While
he was thus occupied, and Hannes was holding the persistently
silent criminal, the burgomaster kept walking
round and round his captive in order to see what sort of a
fish he had got in his net. In this he would probably have
been unsuccessful, had not the moon, in a sudden caprice,
shone out brightly once more. When the triumvirate saw
the pale face, paler than ever with the fright and the cold
moonlight, and perceived it to be the face so well known to
them, all their astonishment uttered itself in the simultaneous
cry—</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Dominie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The school was empty, and the children had a holiday,
for the Dominie&nbsp;... was sitting in the vault under the
tower.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the tower sat the Dominie, amidst pieces of old
iron and other rubbish. Light and air stole in shyly, in
small quantities, through the little, square, grated window,
in which a single scrap of glass, dusty and weather-stained,
remained in one corner, to show there had once been a pane.
As the court-house was surrounded by a paddock, which
again was enclosed by a low wall, the sounds from outside
only penetrated indistinctly, as a vague murmur, into this
chamber. Sometimes it was quiet,—deadly still, there,
especially of an evening, and then life came into the place,
for the rats and mice began their games. The Master was
an old man, and nervous, and he could not sleep much.
He thought over the whole matter in his wakeful hours, and
it gradually became clear to him that he had been arrested
by mistake.... Klaas had stolen Jan van ’t Hout’s pears,
and he, the Dominie, had been taken for the thief returning
for a second load. But it would not be difficult to prove
his innocence. Only it was lasting a long time; he ought
surely to have been tried before now. Four days had
passed without his hearing anything. Even the veldwachter,
who, as a rule, could not be with him two minutes without
wanting to relate some story or other, was now silence itself,
when he brought the Dominie his daily rations. What was
the meaning of this delay?</p>

<p>“SITTING IN THE VAULT UNDER THE TOWER.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Yes, the delay had well-founded reasons! The burgomaster
had indeed caught the fish, but he did not exactly
know what he was to do with him. It was a ticklish business.
Was he to hand over the prisoner immediately,
without the form of a trial, to the authorities in town? or
was he first to hold an inquiry, and send up the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</span></i>
along with the prisoner? Supposing the latter to be the
case, how was he to set about it? It was a most unfortunate
circumstance that there had never been any thieves in
the parish, for now the burgomaster was most certainly at
his wits’ end. The secretary—a poor, infirm old man,
almost in his dotage—was consulted in vain. The same
result attended a conference with the “law-holders.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
Finally the burgomaster called Kobus to his assistance.
He reflected for some time, and said at last:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t it say in the communal bye-laws?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This case is one for which no provision is made in the
<cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gemeentewet</span></cite>” said the burgomaster, with admirable composure,—the
truth being that the greater part of the
Gemeentewet was Greek to him, and that he had gradually
picked up, by practical experience, what knowledge he
possessed of his official duties. Kobus, however, was very
far from suspecting any such subtleties, and believed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>superior implicitly. His invention being now exhausted,
he confined himself to remarking, with a sigh, “If it hadn’t
been the Dominie himself, now, we might have asked him—he
could surely have looked it up somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, that would have been too absurd. They could not
have brought the Dominie all his books in a wheelbarrow, and
requested him to “look up” information as to what was to
be done with himself! No—that would not do. But all
at once an expedient occurred to Kobus. There was an
old, old man in the village—a grey-beard of ninety or
more. Perhaps in his young days there might have been
such a thing as a malefactor in this rural region. Yes, the
idea was not such a bad one, and Kobus was sent as a
delegate from the government to this oracle of antiquity.
In fact, the old man had a suggestion ready. He remembered
that some sixty years ago an analogous case had
occurred, and then the burgomaster had first examined the
culprit himself, and then sent him to town for trial. He
added, however, that the burgomaster on that occasion had
not been quite certain of what he ought to do. That, however,
did not matter so much—the precedent was there in
any case. The schoolmaster then must be examined; and,
as Mulders had once been present at a trial in court, the
forms of justice presented no such great difficulty after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the fifth day after his arrest, the schoolmaster was
haled forth from the dungeon under the tower, and—of
course, heavily handcuffed—taken to the council-chamber.
That was an event. The whole village formed a long
procession, which accompanied the prisoner; and when he
was taken inside, his train remained hanging about the doors.
Then followed a buzz and clatter among the crowd, as
though it were a swarm of bees, or a duck-yard.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“THAT WAS AN EVENT.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“It’s too bad,” said a little old woman; “an old white-haired
man like that. What may not a man come to?
Only yesterday he was teaching my daughter’s children
their lessons, and to-day the poor lambs are running after
their master, because he’s been in jail just like some nasty
vagabond. And I can’t believe it of him, do you know—anything
but that. He has always been much too kind to
every one. I’m not the only one here whom he has helped
for nothing—nothing at all—without your having to pay a
cent for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but, mother,” began a rich farmer,—with a face and
attitude in which the most condescending amiability could
not altogether hide the lowest greed, and a stupid arrogant
conceit,—“you must understand that there are well-founded
reasons—I say, <em>well-founded reasons</em>—for the man to have
been taken up—eh? That’s surely self-evident—eh? No
one is put into handcuffs without important reasons; there
must be a ground for such a motive—I say, <em>for such a
motive</em>.” And then the mighty orator looked round him
with a “What do you think of me now?” expression, and
enjoyed his victory over the old woman. But the latter was
not to be driven from the field so easily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You go along with your French talk. I know nothing
about that,—and yet I think I know quite as much as you do
yourself. But this I know, that it doesn’t look well for you, of
all people, to abuse the schoolmaster anyway. Even though it
were as clear as a post above the water that the Dominie had
stolen, <em>you</em> ought to stand up for him! Do you understand
me—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rich farmer understood quite well. When his youngest
boy had been lying ill some months ago, he had been too
mean to send for a doctor, though he could well afford it,
and had called the schoolmaster to his assistance. Then,
as at other times, the Dominie had said “No,” to keep up
appearances, as he was not supposed to practise any more;
but he had thought “Yes,” and acted on his thought. And
the rich farmer had paid him nothing. This was why he
now hurriedly turned away from this covert attack, muttering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>something about “old creatures getting quite childish,”
but abstained from further contradiction.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the old woman could not be everywhere at once to
take the Dominie’s part, and the conclusion of most conversations
was this: “Yes, you see, folks don’t call a cow
piebald, when there’s not a spot about her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, however, all voices were hushed before the
reverently-uttered magic formula, “The Burgomaster!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The crowd parted to let him pass, and he went up to the
council-chamber, where the faithful Kobus, in his Sunday
suit, was awaiting him. He was already going to meet the
burgomaster, in order to tell him that “they” were all there;
but the great man was looking straight in front of him, as
stiff as a poker, and making, in a direct line, for his official
chair, like a guest who, on being ushered in, looks neither
to right nor left, but makes straight for the lady of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was “the proper form.” Kobus was so impressed
by this ceremonial that he stared with open mouth and eyes,
and remained immovable, like a masculine counterpart of
Lot’s wife. The burgomaster had elegant manners, that he
had.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are all present?” asked the burgomaster, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kobus awakened with a start from his ecstatic trance.
“Yes, your worship,” he answered, regaining his composure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the trial may begin,” said the President of the
Court. “And you, Veldwachter, do you caligraph it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t altogether understand, your worship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caligraph, Veldwachter!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!—ah!—hm—yes, I don’t understand——.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Write it down, Veldwachter. Caligraphy—that is the
art of writing, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, your worship.” Kobus sat down at a table,
took up a pen, and bent over a sheet of paper. But the
paper was destined to remain unsoiled. For, all of a sudden,
the burgomaster looked round him, and, probably struck by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the emptiness of the room, inquired, “Veldwachter, are all
the witnesses present?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the witnesses are present, your worship,” answered
Kobus, indicating, with a majestic wave of the hand, his
solitary son Hannes, who sat so forlorn, that, looking at
him and the schoolmaster, it would have been hard to say
which was witness and which defendant; for the Dominie had
his handcuffed hands on his knees under the table, and you
would not have guessed from his calm features—pale and
worn with the fatigues of the last few days—that he was
accused of any crime.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” pursued Kobus, “your worship has just said something
that gives me an idea. Ought there not to be some
other witnesses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Other witnesses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I mean witnesses to witness <em>for</em> him, do you see?
I mean to say, Hannes sits here, for instance, to speak
against—I mean against the Dominie,—but ought there not
to be some witnesses to speak for him as well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The burgomaster began to think. This was a difficult
question, one of those ticklish and delicate problems, the
solution of which forms the principal <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i> of a burgomaster’s
career. If only this miserable trial had never begun!
He cast a furtive glance at the defendant. If only he could
consult the Dominie, and ask him to look up his books about
the matter! But away with such humiliating thoughts! No;
better, if it must be, to manifest his ignorance in a more
becoming way: “Veldwachter, is that what they do in
town? It was different in my time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They do it that way now, your worship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we had better move with the times, and adapt
ourselves to the new usages. But where are the—the <em>for</em>-witnesses
to come from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! there’s a whole crowd outside the door, your
worship—perhaps you might find one among them. And if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>there’s no one to be had—well, at any rate, we’ve done our
best to find one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go outside, then, and proclaim a summons, on my
behalf.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kobus went and did so, wording the “proclamation” as
clearly as he knew how. But a deathly stillness was all the
answer he received. For though many a simple soul was
honestly convinced of the defendant’s innocence, and though
here and there a solitary voice had been raised in his favour,—to
go in there, into the council-chamber,—<em>to stand before
the tribunal</em>,—that was more than those timid folk could
undertake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, however, a shrill voice cried, “Well, if no one
else will do it, I will.” And the little old woman who had
already taken up the cudgels for the Dominie, forced her
way hastily to the front of the crowd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look’ee there; Auntie’s going to speak,” cried various
voices. Every one repeated, laughing, “Auntie’s going to
speak!” for under this name the old lady was known to all
the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>Auntie cared neither for laughter nor tears, but went
straight forward, climbed the court-house steps, and then
suddenly turned round, waved her thin old arms, and cried
as loud as she could, “You’re a pack of cowards, the lot of
you,—do you hear, you great loobies?” Then she disappeared
inside. And though she was a funny figure enough
as she stood there, no one thought of laughing,—they all
felt the truth of Auntie’s words too deeply.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
<img src='images/i_030.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“YOU’RE A PACK OF COWARDS.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Auntie was conducted inside by the veldwachter, and her
eye immediately fell on her client. The Dominie remained
seated in the same attitude, discouraged and dejected—deeply
humiliated by the thought that, at his age, with his
aspirations and such a past behind him, he should have to bow
his head beneath the weight of a criminal accusation! The
trouble dimmed his thinking powers, and drove the blood
through his veins at lightning speed. What a hammering
in his pulses—what a thumping in his temples—what a rushing
in his ears! He felt like a swimmer who has been long
under water, and finds it press more and more crushingly on
him, and hears its noise in his ears. That was the fever—the
fever that was rising higher and higher in his blood, and
brought that unnatural flush to his usually pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Auntie looked at the sad spectacle he presented, and her
indignation rose, and craved for immediate utterance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Burgomaster!” she began, “don’t you call it a shame
that the Dominie——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But her flow of words was immediately interrupted by the
burgomaster: “Silence! witness, this is not as it should be.
You have come here to give your evidence voluntarily, and
to do this effectually all the forms must be observed. Witness,
what is your name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I never—my name! Just as though the whole
village didn’t know me? Come, come, Burgomaster,
every one knew my name long before yours was ever thought
of; and do you want to pretend that you don’t know me?
No, man, that won’t do. All those grand manners won’t go
down with old Auntie. All the same, I can tell you plainly
why the poor fellow could not have stolen the pears; and so
you are quite out of it, with all your fine forms and speeches,
do you see? Now just let me ask you, if he took the pears,
where did he leave them,—say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Auntie placed her arms akimbo, and assumed an
attitude which seemed to say, “Your turn now—come on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the opposite party remained passive. The burgomaster,
as it happened, was seized with a violent fit of
coughing, which seemed as though it could not come to an
end. It was a pity, for, but for that, surely, the wise man
would have answered the conundrum with Solomonic perspicuity.
The veldwachter-clerk said, “Hm, hm—yes, yes,”
and covered his beard with his hand. The witness for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>prosecution yawned with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i> and hunger. The defendant
sat still, and looked at the old woman with rigid eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all things come to an end, and so did the presiding
judge’s cough. However, he seemed to have coughed away
all his judicial sagacity, for he remained silent. Not so Kobus
Mulders, who awakened from his reverie after this fashion—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes,—where did he leave them? I only say, your
worship,—where did he leave the pears, if he stole them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, that’s what I should like to know,” said Auntie,
shortly, and closed her lips with a look of firm conviction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” resumed Kobus, “he can’t have swallowed them
all down at once.” This joke appeared to him so inexpressibly
funny, that he burst into a loud hoarse laugh,
which was echoed by no one except Hannes. But suddenly
the joker’s features became rigid, and he looked at every one
present with a face whose expression plainly said, “How is
it possible that I did not think of it before?” and exclaimed,
“I know! Your worship, the little chest that we found in
Klaas’s cottage the day after he died——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Kobus?” asked the burgomaster, in great excitement—so
much so that he quite forgot to speak officially.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the Dominie’s, and now I understand everything.
The Dominie <em>didn’t</em> steal, and Auntie is quite right. It could
not be, either. Just listen. The Dominie has been at his
doctoring again. He went to see Klaas when he was dying,
and forgot to take his medicine-chest away with him when
he left. I am quite sure it is his medicine-chest, because it
is the same thing I used to see in his hands in the old
times, when nobody minded his doctoring folks. And the
time just corresponds. On the day after we arrested the
Dominie, I went to see Klaas, and found him dead. It’s as
plain—as—well, it’s quite plain!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Every one had listened with the greatest attention, and
the explanation seemed to have made a deep impression on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>all. The Dominie, however, seemed to feel it most. He
suddenly started up out of his apathy, leaned his handcuffed
hands on the table, and tried to speak. Everything melted
into a dull roar inside his head—the light turned to scarlet—he
had fainted.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of them hastened up to help him—Auntie foremost,
in spite of her old legs. Slowly he came to himself again,
and then he tried to think. He remembered what had
happened, in a dim sort of way. What now? What should
he answer if they asked him whether Kobus’s supposition
was correct? It was—and yet, if he acknowledged that he
had gone to Klaas on that particular evening to give him
medical help, then he would have to expect for the future so
strict a supervision of his forbidden practice, that it would
thenceforth be almost impossible to carry it on. And he
could not give it up—he could not, and would not. But to
be looked on as a thief! Oh, if he could only think—think
quietly and calmly. But this fever! this fever! No, it was
his duty, his calling, and he must be true to it, though he
should be crushed by the contempt of the whole world—the
world he longed to do good to. And wildly, as a wave of
delirium swept over him, he said, “No! no! no! I didn’t
do that! The chest is not mine! I know nothing about
it, and wish to know nothing—do you hear? I am no
doctor; I am only a poor schoolmaster! I am much too
stupid to be a doctor, and I have never done anything of
the sort! I’m a thief—a wretched thief—a thief!” He
cried shrilly once more, with all his strength, “A thief!”
and let his burning head drop on his heaving breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>His hearers looked at each other. Not one of them now
believed in his guilt, and even in the burgomaster—who was
only narrow-minded, not bad-hearted—every hostile feeling
now gave place to pity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Dominie,” he said, laying his hand on the old
man’s shoulder, “come, you mustn’t make so much of it as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>all that. We all understand the whole business now; and
as for the medicine-chest, I forbid every one here present
to say one word about it!” At these words the burgomaster
looked round him with such a solemn air of command, that
Kobus cast down his eyes, and Hannes shuddered with
sheer reverence. But the great man, mindful of his duties
as presiding judge, went on—“Now, defendant, you are
acquitted; you may go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Auntie flew up in a storm of indignation. “What!
go? My patience, me! Burgomaster, don’t you see the
poor soul can hardly sit in his chair? Come, Hannes, you
great lout, what are you loafing about there for, you great
long booby, you? Run out, and tell them to send some menfolks
to carry the Dominie home. Quick now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This classic oration produced a visible impression on
Hannes, and, before long, he came back with several men,
who carried the schoolmaster away, Auntie walking behind,
and saying, from time to time, “Take care! take care!”
When it became known outside that the Dominie’s innocence
was established, every one set up a loud cry of joy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inside, however, the burgomaster and Kobus were looking
at each other with serious faces. “I haven’t written
down anything, with all the confusion,” said Kobus. The
burgomaster considered. If the matter were reported in
town, he would probably get well laughed at for his mistake.
And what about the forms in which such a narrative, if
reported, would have to be clothed? No; it was best to
put the whole thing aside, and say no more about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Veldwachter, it seems to me that this matter is not now
of sufficient importance for us to communicate it to the
judicial authorities of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parquet</span></i>; so you may go too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without understanding half of this speech, Kobus was
able to catch the burgomaster’s drift,—the matter was at an
end. So he went home, reflecting how frightfully learned
the burgomaster was.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>MY HERO.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I was a boy of twelve or thirteen, and, just like other boys
of that age, full of life, mischief, ideals, and illusions.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good-for-nothing little scamp out of school, I was,
under the master’s eye, a queer mixture of the genuine
mischief-loving boy and the zealous pupil. If I found no
attraction in the dry science of arithmetic and the rules of
grammar, all the more did I feel attracted by the history of
all nations in general, and ours in particular.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet not altogether; it was only the warlike Spartans and
Romans, our own crusading knights, and the fierce and
enterprising Gueux,—in short, only those whom I looked
upon as heroes who could arrest my attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frequently it vexed me that my lunch-slice of bread
and butter did not consist of black, coarse bread; sometimes
I felt a deep disdain for my clothes, so different from
those in which the Roman legions marched to victory; all
peaceable merchant-vessels were an abomination to me,—I
knew but one ideal—to be a hero.</p>

<p class='c009'>What I understood by a hero was not quite clear, even to
myself,—only this was certain, that no one could be a hero
unless he had won many great battles over stronger adversaries,
or had blown up his ship in order to save the flag, or
ended his glorious life covered with wounds in the breast
(never in the back, of course!). In short, my idea of a hero
was somewhat complicated; but this much was certain,
that a great hero ought to be able to show a large number
of wounds and scars, and that his bravery should be
equalled by his generosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wished to be a hero myself, but as I quite understood
that I was too young for the position at present, my great
desire was, at least, to see and know a hero.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>I sought everywhere for this superior being, and thought
at last that I had found my ideal in our new “odd man,”
who had been a soldier, and had a large scar on his cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this one outward and visible token of his bravery,
I argued that he must have more hidden about his person,
under his clothes. These wounds, alas! I could never hope
to see, as he did not live in the house, but came every day
to clean boots and run errands.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was, however, firmly convinced that they existed. The
only drawback to his greatness was the fact that he had both
his arms and no wooden leg. I would much rather it had
been otherwise, but managed to content myself with his
many unseen wounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was still seeking an opportunity of asking him how and
when he had become a hero, when I was suddenly bereft of
my illusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our kitchenmaid was beforehand with me.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, when I had furtively slipped out to the kitchen,
in order to question Frans, I heard Mie, our maid, say—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, Frans, have you been in the wars, that you have
such a mark over your face?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he replied—</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the wars! I believe you! We’ve nothing more to
do with wars in this country, now! No,—when I was
leaving the service, I treated my chum one night. But
he got drunk and outrageous, and chucked me through a
window, so that I cut my face open. No—I didn’t get it
in the wars—and jolly glad of it, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I stood thunderstruck—the tears rose in my eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>No wounds on his breast! Even the scar was a delusion
and a snare. I no longer believed in living heroes. They
no longer existed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I was going to be a hero all the same. And till I
was able to re-introduce the breed, I would content myself
with the dead heroes of the past.</p>

<p>“I HAD FURTIVELY SLIPPED OUT TO THE KITCHEN.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>But there were so many of them—and I wanted a special
hero all to myself. Where should I find him?</p>

<p class='c009'>De Ruyter was a hero, killed by the enemy’s shot—but I
had nowhere read that he had many wounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bayard!—but I knew so little of him—and besides, he
was not a Dutchman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cæsar—Napoleon—Blücher!—but how about the
wounds?</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides, every one knew that these were heroes; and I
wanted one for myself—for my own special worship—not
one of the universally famous ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>My search, however, was not to be fruitless long. I
found my hero in the following way.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were to be drains laid down round the old church
in our city; and the ground being dug up for that purpose,
a number of skulls and bones were found in the black
earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the boys of the school went to look as soon as they
could get away, and it may be supposed that I did not remain
behind. We were all inspired with a frenzied enthusiasm
for relics of antiquity. We grubbed about in the
earth of the opened graves, to find coins, pots, or even
potsherds if we could get nothing else. We envied the
town workmen, who were allowed to keep on digging and
finding all day long; and scarcely had it struck twelve
when we flew to the Kerkplein, to see what these greedy
persons had left us, and to discover anything that might
have escaped their search.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we found nothing—neither did the diggers. Most of
the boys, therefore, gave up the search—I, alone, did not.
I was seeking a dead, unknown hero,—while they were looking
only for coins and nicknacks. I knew for certain that
I should find something, when there were not so many eyes
on the watch, and therefore I remained away from school
one morning in order to go to the old churchyard.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>For a long time nothing at all had been found—not even
bones or mouldering boards; so that all the other boys too—those
who did not belong to our school—had grown tired
of coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>Luck, however, was with me!</p>

<p class='c009'>On one particular spot, at some distance from the church,
pieces of skeletons again began to be dug up. The workmen
examined the earth to see if it contained anything of
value, but found nothing. My eager eye, however, spied
among the clods a lump of a different colour. I loosened
the earth from it, and found, to my great joy, a flattened
bullet.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was a discovery!</p>

<p class='c009'>I turned over the heap of earth, and thus came into
possession of six bullets, and a little copper plate covered
with earth and rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bullets!—My hero was found!</p>

<p class='c009'>Reverently I picked up some bones which had been
thrown aside, and carefully packed the remains of my hero
in my school satchel.</p>

<p class='c009'>My hero!—a real hero now!—not an imaginary one, like
Frans, the odd man.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I came home, in a tumult of joyful excitement, I
secured my treasure safely in my play-box, to which I had a
key. And then I had my hero safe—all to myself!</p>

<p class='c009'>At dinner, I looked round triumphantly, and felt the
deepest disdain for my parents and sisters. They had never
made such a discovery! They could not even understand
what it is to possess the very remains of a hero—the hero
himself! I scarcely ate anything for pride and joy, till my
mother said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Con, you’re not eating. Are you not well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I could only stammer a few words, and then thrust a whole
potato into my mouth in order to prove my appetite, which,
happily, reassured my mother.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>As soon as dinner was over, I darted to my own room to
assure myself that I had not been dreaming, and that my
hero existed in very truth. The bones and bullets, and the
little metal plate, were there still.</p>

<p class='c009'>I contemplated them all once more, with a look full of
love and reverence, and went downstairs again, so as to
arouse no suspicion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never had I been a better-behaved boy than on that evening.
I played with my little sister as nicely as possible; I
was obedient as I had never been before,—all for fear that
some unlucky circumstance might lead to a discovery of my
hero on the part of my parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last it was time to go to bed. At last I was alone with
the sacred relics of the man who had stood six bullets, without
reckoning the innumerable wounds—to be taken for
granted—on his breast!</p>

<p class='c009'>I gazed at the bones, brown and dirty as they looked—at
the flattened bullets, and rusty bit of metal, with deep reverence.
The plate probably bore his name; but if so, it was
illegible with the dirt. Should I clean it? I burned
with eagerness to know his name, and felt half inclined to
do it; but desisted, thinking that, being rusty, and covered
with earth, it would prove its age much better than if it were
bright and polished up like new.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, after long contemplation of my treasures, I locked
them up, and put the key under my pillow, for fear of
burglars. Once in bed, however, I could get no sleep.
All sorts of ideas relating to my hero crossed and recrossed
my brain.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place, I resolved to make a secret of him. It
is a glorious thing to have a secret all to one’s self—and
such a secret!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was settled, then—no one was to see or hear anything
of him. I alone was to possess my Hero, and be able to
worship Him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Then I began to wonder who he could have been, and
when he had lived, and where he had fought and died.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite clear to me that the six bullets represented
but a small part of his wounds, for it was not possible
that he had been killed on the field of battle by the sixth
of those bullets. I knew that the fallen are always buried
on the field of honour. Therefore he must have died of
other wounds,—probably sword-cuts, lance-thrusts, or the
like.... Then I fancied all sorts of biographies for
my hero.</p>

<p class='c009'>I should have liked best of all for him to have been a
Crusader; but I was forced to give up that idea, seeing
that in those days there were no guns, and therefore no
bullets.</p>

<p class='c009'>I therefore resolved to seek in more modern times.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Water Gueux slain in fight? That, too, would not do.
<em>They</em> were wrapped in a flag, and with a “One, two, three—in
God’s name,” let down into the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>I weighed all possible cases—to reject them again immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last I hit upon the following, which satisfied me pretty
well:—My hero had fought in Napoleon’s wars, and was for
his valour promoted by the great Emperor to the rank of
general. In all battles he had been foremost, and many a
wound bore witness to his courage. Napoleon had even
chosen out a kingdom for him; when fortune changed, and
all nations rose to free themselves from the power of the
great conqueror.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then my hero had left his place in the army, and his
exalted offices, and had ranged himself under his country’s
flag to serve her as a private soldier.</p>

<p class='c009'>After giving numerous proofs of courage, he was so
severely wounded at the battle of Waterloo,—where he
defended the colours of his regiment, single-handed, against
a large number of the foe,—that he felt his end approaching.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>And when he knew that the victory was won, he dragged
himself home to his native town to die.</p>

<p class='c009'>His funeral was a splendid one, and the fallen hero was
buried in a spot apart from others, who were not thought
worthy to be near him, even in death.</p>

<p class='c009'>This last circumstance I added, after long consideration,
to explain the isolated position of my hero’s grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another difficulty, however, presented itself. Why was
there no monument erected to him?</p>

<p class='c009'>The solution of this question cost me no little trouble.
In our church there were two splendid monuments, with
beautiful Latin verses on them; and the men who slept
under them were of far less importance than my hero. But
here, too, there was an explanation. My hero himself had
said on his deathbed that he did not wish for a monument,
but preferred to rest simply under the green grass;—his
name would live well enough without one!</p>

<p class='c009'>This, however, raised a new difficulty. I had never heard
of any hero buried in the former burying-ground close to
the church. Happily, however, I remembered to have read
somewhere that “ingratitude is the world’s reward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was forgotten!</p>

<p class='c009'>That grieved me deeply; but I determined with myself
to revive the memory of his name, when I should be somewhat
older, and could write in the papers, and become a
member of the Useful Knowledge Society. Then I would
tell people how great my hero had been, and how ungratefully
the world had treated him. Till then, he should
remain my secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course I had adorned him with all sorts of chivalric
qualities. I had seen him in my thoughts as the protector
of helpless women, as the avenger of wrong; I had seen
him risk his life at the command of his superiors, and in
order to win one look from his lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>And I had ended by endowing him with the crowning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>grace of modesty. Of this I was not a little proud. I
knew for certain that all the other boys’ heroes would be
brutal and arrogant, and set upon getting monuments for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mine, however, was modest&nbsp;... and his reward was
oblivion.... Yes—till I should arise&nbsp;... <em>then</em> my hero
should be greater than all others.</p>

<p class='c009'>Happy that now I knew <em>all</em> about my hero, youth and
excitement were too much for me, and I fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning I arose, no longer a boy—not even a man.
I was a great man. I had a task before me. I must give
back to my hero his just fame and honours.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had even assumed a new manner!—marbles and suchlike
games were now beneath me,—and I thought the other
boys uninteresting and childish. They, on their part, soon
found that I had become tiresome and pedantic, and asked
me if I had come in for a fortune, and was now too much
of a swell for them. I only laughed, and wrapped myself
once more in my own glory.</p>

<p class='c009'>This lasted a few days, and then I began to find out that
the solitary enjoyment of glory and a secret was not so
great a pleasure as I had thought. Happily I had two bosom
friends—Wil and Ed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I resolved, after many heart searchings of heart, to share
my wealth with these two. After I had sworn them to secrecy,
and also exacted a solemn promise that they would not
endeavour to appropriate my hero to themselves, I told
them of my discovery, and all I knew of him,—for what I
had myself imagined now seemed like truth to me. I
enjoyed their evident jealousy, and, still more, their admiration
and reverence for me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Con,” said Wil at last, “what is the hero’s name,
really?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I stood aghast. I had never thought of that! But they
shall never exult over me because I did not know the name
of my own hero. So I mentioned the first name that came
into my head—“Jan Liller.”</p>

<p>“AFTER I HAD SWORN THEM TO SECRECY.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Happily, they believed me.</p>

<p class='c009'>From that day forward there was a constant whispering
among us, a mystery in our conversation, even on the most
unimportant subjects, which drove all the other boys wild with
curiosity. But we revealed nothing. We had even determined,
for fear of discovery, never to speak of my hero
otherwise than as “L. J.”—even when we were alone.
J. L. seemed to us much too dangerous.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes little boys were sent out to listen to us, under
pretence of carrying on their games in our neighbourhood.
But we were on our guard, and only talked all sorts of nonsense
when the small spies were within hearing. Thus my secret
did not leak out. Yet we could not be silent altogether.</p>

<p class='c009'>In school, when the master told us about the great men
of our country, from Claudius Civilis to William the Silent,
we smiled pityingly, and said to each other, afterwards—</p>

<p class='c009'>“L. J. could have done better than that!”—or, “They
ought to have tried L. J.; he could have taught them something!”—and
the like—so that we began to be called
“L. J.’s.” But we took great care that no one should find
us out, and were very proud of our secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>I say <em>our</em> secret,—yet, after all, it was really mine, for I
had shown the bullets, the metal plate, and the bones neither
to Wil nor to Ed. They thus only knew the half—and no
more than I had thought fit to tell them. The finest and
most important part of all was unknown to them. Of course
they acted as if they had been <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</span></i> in the whole thing;
but they were nothing of the sort.</p>

<p class='c009'>At home, my changed behaviour began gradually to
attract general attention. I had assumed a mysteriousness
of demeanour, from which my father—judging from long
experience—argued that there must be some special piece
of mischief on hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>As I frequently remained lost in thought, and no longer
cared for games as I used to do (I thought them childish
since the discovery of my hero), my mother came to the
conclusion that I was not well; while my little sister, of
course, was as curious as a girl can be. Therefore the
three, each for his or her own reason, were constantly at my
heels. I soon noticed this, and it was no small hindrance
to my doings and projects.</p>

<p class='c009'>I scarcely dared to produce my hero, for fear some one
should come to my room unawares and surprise me in the
midst of my relics, and so discover my secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>My plans, more especially, were in danger!</p>

<p class='c009'>I wished—as a homage to the glorious Jan Liller—to
make an elegant little casket, lined with precious bits of
silk, plush, and lace, to preserve therein his precious relics,
and the glorious evidences of his heroic existence. I
intended to make the fretwork casket myself,—but I durst
not do it in the general sitting-room. Whenever I could, I
stole away to my own little room, and went to work there.
Once I was surprised by my mother when very busy; but
when she saw my work, she pretended not to have noticed
anything. My conscience reproached me bitterly; for I
understood that my dear mother had thought I was working
at a present for her approaching birthday.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, for the moment, my hero took precedence of everything.
I hoped to be able to buy something for my mother’s
birthday, trusting to the ready aid of my father’s purse.</p>

<p class='c009'>On a certain day, when I was out for a walk with my
father, he suddenly said to me, “Well, Con, is the digging
in the Kerkplein all over? I have not been there for some
time. I suppose you have been there to see whether anything
in your line has been turned up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Did my father suspect anything? and was he fishing?</p>

<p class='c009'>I answered evasively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not been there since last week.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
<img src='images/i_047.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<p>“DID MY FATHER SUSPECT ANYTHING?”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>That was true—for just a week ago I had found my hero—and
after I had found him, I was satisfied. The charm
of rooting about among the graves had vanished. There
was nothing more to find now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I only thought,” said my father, jokingly, “that you
had found a treasure—you are so mysterious lately. Say,
my boy, have you grown rich, and are you going to keep
your money all to yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have never found anything, father,” I stammered, full of
shame at the lie, and yet full of satisfaction at my courage—in
daring to tell a falsehood to save my hero from discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Happily my father changed the subject, by asking me if I
had any present in view for mother’s birthday. To be
honest, I had to answer no, for my hero had taken up all
my thoughts and energies. But just as I was thinking
what to say, a great, a glorious idea rose up in me. What
could be a better present for my mother than my hero?</p>

<p class='c009'>At the sacrifice of my secret,—of my own discovery,—I
would surprise her with the revelation of my find, and share
my hero with her! It was a hard struggle, but, once
resolved, I could say with cheerful assurance, “Yes, father,
I have something very, very nice!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s good, my boy!” said my father, as he patted
me approvingly on the shoulder. “Do your best to make
it so, for your mother deserves it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Since the old churchyard had been mentioned, I was
eager to find out if my father knew anything about my
hero. Therefore I asked, with as careless an air as I
could assume—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, father, who used to be buried in that place round
the church?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, my boy, I don’t know. It must be at least fifty
years since that burying-ground was used. When I came
to live here the new cemetery was already opened, and I
really do not know who was buried in the old place.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“But, father, did you never hear of <em>any</em> one that was
buried there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said my father; but, after thinking a little, he
went on: “Yes, I do, though! they buried Kees Van
Assen there. I heard so the other day from Notary Van
Tefelen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Could that be my hero? It might well be, why else
should the old burying-ground have been mentioned at the
notary’s?</p>

<p class='c009'>Surely, then, he must have been a great-uncle or distant
cousin of that odious Alfred, whom we always called “the
Muff,” because he never would join our games for fear of
getting bruised and scratched, or soiling his clothes and
hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was Van Assen a hero, father?” I uttered the words
with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A hero, my boy? No, certainly not. No, quite the
contrary!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A coward, father? I thought as much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, and why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because that stupid boy of the minister’s is Van
Assen too, and he <em>is</em> a coward!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That does not follow. This Van Assen was not in any
way related to the minister’s family. At least I believe not.
But he was not a coward, he was far worse. He was a
traitor to his country. He betrayed the town to the
French.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what did they do to a low fellow like that?” I
asked, full of pain and indignation that a countryman of
mine could have betrayed his native town to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At first, nothing; for at that time he was protected by
the French. But when they were gone, his fellow-townsmen
razed his house to the ground, and he was shot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he was buried in the churchyard?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes; because his family was a rich and distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>one, they consented to bury him in the churchyard;
but, of course, it was done without show or splendour.
I know no more about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you know in which corner he was buried?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, the corner by the baker’s shop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now there were two corners of the churchyard which
had a baker’s shop near them. Near one of them, I had
found my hero; but he was called Jan Liller, and not Van
Assen! I resolved never more to buy tarts or buns in the
corner where the traitor was buried,—that was accursed
from henceforth. We had been in the habit of going there,
because we got far more for our money than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>It now at once became clear to me that this baker knew
of the traitor’s neighbourhood, and was afraid of losing his
customers unless he sold his goods very cheap!</p>

<p class='c009'>I had not thus gained much information by my inquiries.
Only I had found a new point of comparison, my hero
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</span></i> Van Assen! Jan Liller was dearer to me than before,
now that I could contrast him with a contemptible Van
Assen! My hero had become greater than ever!</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as I reached home, I ran to my own little room,
in order to gaze my fill on his relics—to steep my soul in
his greatness.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the stairs I felt for my key.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was that? It was not in my pocket! I had not lost
it—I was certain of that. Then I must have left it sticking
in my box, and in that case my secret—my hero was lost!</p>

<p class='c009'>A terrible fear overcame me. My steps dragged on the
stairs. With a sinking heart I opened my door,—my presentiment
had not deceived me!</p>

<p class='c009'>There stood my little sister before the open box!</p>

<p class='c009'>“You horrid girl—what are you doing with my things?
Keep off!” I screamed, when I saw my secret revealed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Con! you had left the key in the lock, and I just
looked in!” cried my sister, terrified.</p>

everything, and spoiling other people’s things!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Con! don’t be so angry! I only just wanted to
look! And, just see,—I’ve been cleaning up this dirty
little brass plate that was inside. I’ve made it look quite
nice—and there’s some writing on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time she thrust the now glittering brass plate
into my hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything seemed to turn round with me. Everything
was black. I could see nothing but the glittering yellow
plate, and the name engraved on it:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That was indeed a barbarous idea—leaving me at
home. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité bien ordonnée commence par soi-même</span>,”
as we used to say at Paris. My gentleman’s gone out
a-courting, and I may just sit and grumble in these confounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>lodgings! He hasn’t the smallest grain of feeling.
Why couldn’t he remember that while he’s busy making love
to his silly cousin, and flattering his cracked old aunt,—that
is, making fools of both of them,—I might, in the meanwhile,
very appropriately amuse myself with the maid!</p>

<p class='c009'>Pretty little thing, that Sophie! Just a little bit <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête</span></i>, still—but
that will come all right in time—I’ll educate her fast
enough. We haven’t been to Paris for nothing. I had
views on her already, when we were here eighteen months
ago. She was then a mere child, and I had not yet seen
Notre Dame and the Pont-Neuf. In point of fact, come to
think of it, I was still very young, and not <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</span></i> about life.
I can clearly remember getting quite confused when the
postman’s flaxen-haired daughter scolded me for&nbsp;... come,
Frans, let those things rest&nbsp;... she’s at rest herself....
How could I help it, if the girl was so gone on me? Why
didn’t her father take better care of her? What is a father
for, if not to look after his daughter?</p>

<p class='c009'>What a difference, when I think of those days! Confused!
ashamed!—why, I don’t know the meaning of the
words. The only thing I’m ashamed of now, is that I ever
had the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faiblesse</span></i> to be ashamed of anything. And now
that, thanks to my education in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guinguettes</span></i>, I have
become quite a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune homme accompli</span></i>,—now that I might
have begun a nice diversion with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suivante</span></i> of my master’s
intended,&nbsp;... now I’m got rid off with a gruff, “Frans,
stay and look after the room!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He’ll talk in a different tune when he finds he needs me
again to get him out of some scrape or other. Then it is,
“Frans, dear Frans, save me; I don’t know what I’m to
do!” Frans is good enough for that. But besides this,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fond</span></i>, it’s unjust to leave me here indoors. A man is a
man, and has reason and freewill. Jonker Van Bergen
goes out courting. So we see that beings with reason and
freewill do go courting. But I too am a man; I have freewill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and reason—therefore I ought to go out courting too.
That is clear and undeniable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Glorious logic! Precious philosophy! Invaluable gift of
Heaven, which is scattered with generous hand at Paris.
Beloved nurse of all that&nbsp;... that....</p>

<p class='c009'>And with all that I’m sitting here indoors, like Job, on his
ancient sofa. It is annoying; it’s very annoying! It’s the
most annoying thing in the world! It could not possibly
be worse; it’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyant</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étouffant</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embêtant</span></i>!</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Jumps up angrily, and walks backwards and forwards,

<p class='c009'>I’m curious to know whether he’ll get through with his
business, and succeed better than last year. The devil
grant he may! Otherwise it’s all up with him—all up—and
he’s ruined! If he hasn’t made his lady-cousin his own,
with all that belongs to her [<em>goes through the gestures of
counting money</em>], within a month, he’s a dead man! Physically
dead, financially dead, civilly dead,—dead in every
possible way! Dead to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chambertin</span></i>, <em>baronfayol</em>, and champagne;
dead to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillotte</span></i> table; <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dead pour tout ce qui
porte un jupon&nbsp;... enfin</span></i>—burst up!</p>

<p class='c009'>This wouldn’t really matter so much if these gentlemen
hadn’t the disagreeable habit of dragging down every one
about them in their fall. [<em>Makes a wry face.</em>] The cheques!
the cheques!</p>

<p class='c009'>I am anything but <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à monaise</span></i>, as we used to say at Paris.
We have only a month before us. Before that time we
must have money to pay up, or the whole thing will go
smash. And then he’s quite capable of saying that it was I
who forged the cheques. Then come examinations and
cross-examinations, witnesses <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à charge</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à décharge</span></i>;
reply, duplicate, triplicate, or whatever they call it; and the
end of it is that the President puts on the black cap—grim
fashion that!—and has a sentence read out, in which poor
Frans is very badly used on the score of&nbsp;... complicity!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>I might indeed get hold of a lawyer who has studied the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">circonstances atténuantes</span></i>, as we used to say at Paris; but
what’s the good, when the stupid bench don’t understand
them? Civilisation is at such a low ebb in this land of
ours. Quite otherwise over there. I attended a trial in
France&nbsp;... a woman who had committed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sottise</span></i> of
hacking her child to pieces, chopping it up small, and cooking
it&nbsp;... what further could you have? It would have
been a bad look-out for her in this country. Over there,
she simply had to take the precaution of providing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">circonstances
atténuantes</span></i>,&nbsp;... and she got off all right. That’s
what I call philanthropy—civilisation! Just look for civilisation
<em>here</em>! there’s nothing of the sort. Everything is
taken ill here. If your scales or your weights are not quite
right, they take it ill of you! If you call a man a thief or a
scoundrel, in the friendliest way in the world, and can’t produce
your proofs on the spot, they take it ill of you! Just
as if those were not the biggest scoundrels of all against
whom nothing can be proved! If you happen to swear
falsely, they take that ill too! Why, not long ago I heard of
a man undergoing very unpleasant treatment in public,
because he—it seems incredible—because he had set his
own house on fire! Stupid nation this! Not the faintest
notion of the universal rights of mankind! The house
belonged to him; what business was it of people’s what he
did with it? Why shouldn’t he make a bonfire of it as
soon as smoke this “light brown”? (Good cigar, too!)
Yes, they say, but&nbsp;... his <em>next-door neighbour</em>! Stuff and
nonsense! Am <em>I</em> not to illuminate, because somebody else
prefers to sit in darkness? If my next-door neighbour has
cat’s eyes, he had better go and live somewhere else.</p>

<p class='c009'>No, no,—that delicate feeling,—that tact,—that talent for
making black white with all the facility in the world, and
without fear of contradiction,—and above all, the glorious
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">circonstances atténuantes</span></i>,—<em>all these</em> you find only in France!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Splendid invention, those <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">circonstances atténuantes</span></i>! They

the Code Napoléon. They are&nbsp;... in short, they are anything

<p class='c009'>A greater fool than that young Huser I never saw in all

find him; I should go to him, and say, “Huser, my dear
boy, we’ve made a mistake again about a signature or two;
do make yourself responsible for the error—there’s a good
fellow.” I believe, upon my soul! the man would be fool
enough to do it over again. I can’t explain the matter, but
I dare swear that Huser, in spite of his sour face, was the
most faithful chum in the world. I would bet something
that he had been brought up at Paris, or at least had a

<p class='c017'>[<em>Andries lays on with the whip.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans</em> (<em>quickly</em>). Stop!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><em>Van Weller</em>(<em>to Andries</em>). Why are you not thrashing him
as I told you? You hear him trying to make a fool of
me!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Andries.</em> The word was given to stop, General.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> He gave it, not I!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Andries.</em> There was nothing about that in the orders,
General.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> I am in sole command here, of course.
Now speak, you scoundrel, quickly! <em>Out</em>——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Oh, sir! I’m beginning! The next day——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> What? What day? I know nothing yet!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Monsieur Socrates also knew nothing. The recognition
of this fact is the source of all wisdom, General. I am
telling you the story in my own way, beginning at the end.
I belong to the school of M. Dumas and M. Sue.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Don’t wear out my patience any longer,
fellow! Relate consecutively what took place on the last
day of Mr Van Bergen’s life.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> He got up at half-past four in the morning, and put
on his socks and boots. I did not see this, but I am
induced to believe it, as he appeared, a little later, with his
boots and spurs on. It is thus a fair inference that he had
just put them on, unless, like M. Charles Douze, he had
been sleeping in them—in which case....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Are you quite incorrigible? Don’t tell me
the story like that!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Am <em>I</em> to blame? <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">N’est pas conteur qui veut.</span></i> I
did not profess to be a good story-teller, General.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Silence! I ask you for the last time whether
you are willing to relate, in a proper manner, what you know
of the affair?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> About Charles Douze? He was born——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Out!</p>
<p class='c017'>[<em>Andries strikes Frans with the whip, several times.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Ai! ai!—oh! General!—I’ll tell you everything!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span><em>Van Weller.</em> Stop! (<em>To Frans.</em>) Now go on, and think
of your back.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> The old gentleman had come back from an
assembly at Court, the evening before, very much put out.
They said he had had a quarrel, and was to fight a duel next
day. I only know this by tradition, as you may say,
because I and the young master were under arrest,
locked up in the summer house, because we had stolen
apri——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Never mind the apricots, and tell me about
the duel.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Well, then—my master must have slept very badly
that night. This, too, I only know by way of tradition; and
since tradition represents the border-land between the dark
region of myth and the daylight of history——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Out——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Ow!—wait—listen! Next morning he went out at
five o’clock, and came home at half-past six, mortally
wounded. He had a bullet in his left breast, whence I infer
that he had been shot. But I cannot with certainty——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Silence! Who was his adversary?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> That I do not know. The coachman who drove
the master out, said....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>impatiently</em>). Well?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Said he did not know either.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>stamps his foot</em>). Did your master die soon
after?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Yes—at half-past one that afternoon&nbsp;... as near
as I can guess. For, you see, as the young gentleman had
fastened a frog to the pendulum of the big clock that stood
in the hall——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> To the deuce with your frogs and your
clocks! Answer me—did any one come to see Bergen
before his death?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Yes; three officers, one of them a major.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>aside</em>). Ah! that was Huser. (<em>To Frans.</em>)
What happened then?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> They were admitted to see him, but the servants
were sent away. But as I have always been very fond of
tragedy scenes, I managed to peep through the keyhole;
and I saw that the Major fell on his knees beside the bed,
and cried. The kneeling was very well done&nbsp;... his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contenance</span></i> was simply perfect&nbsp;... I was all attention.
Old Mr Van Bergen held out his hand to him, and said——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>rising quickly</em>). That is just what I want to
know—go on!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> That he was thirsty.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>sits down again, as if disappointed</em>). That’s
not what I meant. Go on!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> They gave him something to drink. Then he sat
up in bed, and put his arms round that officer. “Let us
part in peace,” he said, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans rancune</span></i>!” The officer kept
on crying, and said, “Can you ever forgive me, Bergen?”
The master smiled, and said, “Gladly! gladly!—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans rancune</span></i>,
dearest——”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Well—dearest <em>what?</em></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> I couldn’t catch the name. And I never saw
that Major again. I heard that he died about six months
later.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>aside</em>). It must have been Huser—not a
doubt about it! (<em>To Frans.</em>) And then? What happened
next?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> The wounded man asked one of the officers to call
his little Charles—that was the young master, who was still
in the summer-house—<em>I</em> had got out.... The young
gentleman came up to the bed, and, instead of being pleased
at getting out sooner than he expected, he began to cry too.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Go on, go on!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> After being silent for some time, the master said
to the Major——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><em>Van Weller.</em> Go on, do, fellow! I’ve been waiting for
that about an hour!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> He said,—“Don’t distress yourself over my death.
It was in fair fight. My fate might have been yours. Only—be
a father to my poor Charles!”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> What next?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> The Major began to sob again, and cried, “I swear
to you I will!” Then Baron Van Bergen smiled pleasantly,
held out his hand to him once more, and died. [<em>V. W.
remains lost in thought.</em>] It was a touching scene, General.
The old gentleman died almost as naturally as M. Furneau
of the Théâtre Royal. I should have been quite overcome
with emotion if the other two officers had possessed any
knowledge of the stage. They seemed to be novices, who
had never been in Paris. Not the faintest idea of tragic
action—they didn’t even wring their hands! Of course
that of itself gave them a stupid attitude——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Will you hold your tongue? How was it that
you never saw this officer again?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> They said in the kitchen that he was abroad with
his son, and that when he came home he was going to
take Master Charles with him. But he never came back.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> And his son?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> I never heard anything about him.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Have you ever seen him?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Never.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>aside</em>). I think the fellow is lying. (<em>To
Frans.</em>) Did you ever know a man by the name of Huser?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Huser? Yes, very well indeed. He was the young
master’s greatest friend. Or rather—for they weren’t exactly
friends—he was&nbsp;... he did&nbsp;... he gave&nbsp;... well, I
never quite knew what to make of that Huser.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Now we’re getting near it! What became of
Huser?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> H’m!—nothing much!&nbsp;... he did not turn out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>anything to boast of, General. He was careless,—he was fast&nbsp;... that is to say, he wasn’t exactly that. He gambled&nbsp;... at least, no, he never gambled. But&nbsp;... in short, I
don’t know anything about it. All I know is, that he came
to smash in the end.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>aside</em>). Poor Gustav! poor boy! (<em>To Frans.</em>)
Go on, man, tell me all you know.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> He had a difference of opinion with the Procureur
du Roi, as we used to say at Paris. He had been imprudent—(<em>whispers</em>)—forged
cheques!—people took it ill of him,—and—you
know the law, General!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>aside</em>). Poor boy! (<em>To Frans.</em>) But how
was that possible? Was he in debt?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> On the contrary, his father had left him plenty
of money, and he lived very economically.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> And he did not play, you say?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Never. He had old-fashioned notions on that
head.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Was he, perhaps, given to courting?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Oh! no—he was too stiff and solemn for that. He
always looked sulky and discontented. He was a tiresome
sort of fellow. I think, even, that he used to make verses.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> And he was your master’s friend?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> No, and&nbsp;... yes! He was always with us, and
at our rooms. He always helped the young master when he
had the chance; but afterwards he used to give it him like
blazes.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Strange, very strange! And how long ago is
that?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Four years.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> What was your master doing then?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> How? I thought he was at the university.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Well—studying, and doing nothing—that comes
pretty much to the same thing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span><em>Van Weller.</em> And this Huser?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Before that <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fâcheux évènement</span></i> I spoke of, he was
studying too. I think he wanted to be a lawyer....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Silence! Nothing but what I ask you! Is
your master a good sort of man?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> He might certainly be better.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Silence! You deserve a good thrashing.
He is a bad servant that speaks ill of his master. If I ask you
any question that you would injure your master by answering,
then you are to hold your tongue. Do you understand?
I don’t want to make any traitors. Remember this carefully,
or I shall give the word. Did your master play high
at the university? [<em>Frans is silent.</em>]&nbsp;... So—he’s silent&nbsp;...
therefore our young gentleman <em>did</em> play&nbsp;... therefore he
is betraying his master by his silence.... Out!</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Andries strikes him.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> Oh! my dear good gentleman, what <em>am</em> I to say?
No, no, the young master never gambled.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> He lies! Yes—I forgot to say that if you
don’t tell the truth, I shall give the word too. Did your
master gamble at the university? Out!</p>
<p class='c017'>[<em>Andries again raises the whip.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans</em> (<em>points to the window</em>). Fire! fire! for heaven’s
sake!—save yourselves!&nbsp;... fire!</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>The General hastens to the window. Andries remains
rigidly at his post. Frans runs to the door.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Frans.</em> I should have done that sooner. (<em>With a low bow.</em>)
General, your humble servant.</p>
<div class='c012'>[<em>Exit.</em></div>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>returning from the window</em>). I see nothing,
absolutely nothing. Where is the fellow?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Why didn’t you hold him?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Andries.</em> That was not in the orders, sir.</p>

you want here, my girl?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie</em> (<em>looks hard at him</em>). I have a note for young Mr
Van Bergen’s man. (<em>To Andries.</em>) Hasn’t Frans been
here? Surely this is the gentleman’s room? He said
number four, and——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Just give me that note.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Are you Mr Van Bergen’s man too?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Yes. Give it here.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie</em> (<em>to Andries</em>). Will it be all right if I give it to this
man? [<em>Andries does not answer.</em>] Good gracious! what’s
the matter? Why are you standing there as glum and stiff
as if you were on parade?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>to Andries</em>). Who is this pretty child?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Why, that’s fortunate! (<em>To Sophie.</em>) Well,
and how is my sister Koosje?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie</em> (<em>surprised</em>). Your sister Koosje, sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Yes—Mevrouw Wachler!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie</em> (<em>curtseys</em>). Very well, sir. (<em>To Andries.</em>) Think of
that—I never knew that the mistress’s Christian name was
Koosje. Why, that’s a name any one of us might have!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>to Andries</em>). Are you in love with this
charming creature?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Andries.</em> With your permission,—yes, General.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> <em>That’s</em> nice of you, Andries! <em>I</em> never asked any

say, No?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Well, well,—you may make your mind easy,—I
won’t say No! (<em>To Andries, calling him aside.</em>) Something
has just occurred to me. I don’t want that rascal to
tell his master that I have been questioning him. Does
he care about...? [<em>makes the gesture of drinking</em>].</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Andries.</em> Yes, General.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> And try to persuade your sweetheart to stay

<p class='c009'><em>Andries.</em> Yes, General. (<em>To Sophie.</em>) Just give your note

anything, and be as pleasant and polite as you can. Remember,

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Well—what is it now?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> There’s the key, my girl. You have done
your errand well—so go now—just go.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> But Andries said you wanted to talk to me.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Yes&nbsp;... no&nbsp;... it’s hardly needed now....
Or.... (<em>hesitating</em>) How are things going, Sophie?—is
there to be a wedding soon?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie</em> (<em>confused</em>). Yes—if Andries....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> I’m not speaking of Andries now—I mean
in the Van Wachler family.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Ah! I think there will, indeed! for the young lady
has three lovers.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> That’s enough to begin with. I had only
heard of one. And who are they?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie</em> (<em>counts on her fingers</em>). First, Jonkar Van Bergen,—then
the music-master, Holm,—and the third is old Mr Buys.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> What do you say?—a music-master?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Oh, don’t laugh at him, sir—he’s such a good
man! It’s only a pity that he’s always so sad.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> And why do you think he is one of the
young lady’s lovers?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Why—because Mr Van Wachler said so himself.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Surely you misunderstood him, my good girl.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Why so? For my part, I should prefer him to
Jonkar Van Bergen. Mr Holm is less merry and cheerful,
but then one can see that he has had his troubles. They
say he is a prince, who has for some reason or other turned
music-master,—but I’m not sure of that.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span><em>Van Weller.</em> And Jonkar Karel?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Jonkar Van Bergen is—but please don’t say I said
so, sir—I don’t think he is to be trusted. This morning, he
had been talking to Madame about the young lady and Mr
Holm—Madame is very much opposed to the music-master....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> That I can well believe!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Well&nbsp;... he put his arm round her neck and kissed
her, and when she was out of the room he made fun of her,
though she had just been calling him “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charmant garçon</span></i>.”
Later on, I heard him say, “Just as silly as ever! She’ll
choke with her affection some day!” Now, do you call that
a man to be trusted, sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> No, not exactly. [<em>Chucks her under the
chin.</em>] But old Buys now?—how did you come to think of
him?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> I don’t quite understand how it is. I never used
to notice anything. He is nearly as old as you, sir—and
one can’t love a man like that, can one?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>with a start</em>). Ah!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> I mean love like—love as one——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Yes, yes, I understand. I’ll make you a
present of the explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Well—I know nothing about it—but, the other
day, when I went up to her sitting-room—now don’t say I
told you, sir!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> No, no—just go on.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> She was sitting on his knee, and he kissed her.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> Well, I’m surprised at my niece!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Sophie.</em> Oh! don’t think any harm of her, sir! The three
lovers is the only thing, and I don’t think the worse of her
for that! If I were a man, I’d want to be her lover too,—I’m
sure I would!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller</em> (<em>aside</em>). I think I must be on the track.
(<em>To Sophie.</em>) Look here, can you hold your tongue?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span><em>Sophie.</em> Yes—when I’ve nothing to say.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Weller.</em> When you get home, don’t mention having

  <h2 class='c005'><em>DROOGSTOPPEL INTRODUCES HIMSELF.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I am a coffee-broker, and live at No. 37 Lauriergracht.
It is not my custom to write novels, or any such thing; so
it was a long time before I made up my mind to order a
couple of reams of paper and begin the work which you,
dear reader, have just taken up, and which you ought to
read if you are in the coffee business,—or, in fact, if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>are anything else. And not only have I never written
anything which was in the least like a novel, but I don’t
hold with even reading anything of the sort, because I
am a man of business. For several years past, I have
been asking myself, what is the use of such things? and
I am perfectly amazed at the impudence of poets and
novelists in palming off upon you things which have never
happened, and, for the most part, never can happen.
Now, in <em>my</em> business,—I am a coffee-broker, and live in
the Lauriergracht, No. 37,—if I were to send in to a
principal (a principal is a man who sells coffee) an account
containing only a small part of the untruths which
are the main point in all poems and romances—why, he
would at once go to Busselinck &amp; Waterman. (Busselinck
&amp; Waterman are coffee-brokers too; but it is not necessary
for you to know <em>their</em> address.) So I take good care not to
write any novels, or send in wrong accounts. I have always
noticed that persons who let themselves in for that kind of
thing generally get the worst of it. I am forty-three, and
have been at the Exchange for twenty years, so that I have
every right to put myself forward when a man of experience
is in demand. I have seen plenty of firms fail in my time!
And usually, when I examined into the causes of their
failure, it seemed to me that they must be sought for in
the wrong direction given to most people in their youth.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I</em> say, “truth and sound sense!” and that I stick to.
The mistake comes in, in the first place, with Van Alphen;<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
and that in his very first line about the “dear little creatures.”
What on earth could induce this old gentleman to call himself
an adorer of my little sister Truitje, who had sore eyes;
or of my brother Gerrit, who was always biting his nails?
And yet he says that “he sang these verses, compelled by
love.” I used often to think, when I was a child, “Man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>I <em>should</em> like to meet you, just for once—and then, if you
refused me the marbles I should ask you for, or the whole
of my name in chocolate letters” (my name is Batavus),
“then I should consider you a liar.” But I never saw Van
Alphen. I think he was already dead when he used to tell
us that my father was my best friend. I thought far more
of Pauweltje Winser, who lived next door to us. And that
my little dog was so grateful for kindness! We never kept
dogs, because they are dirty.</p>

<p class='c009'>That is the way children are brought up; and, later on,
come other lies again. A girl is an angel! The man who was
the first to discover that, never had any sisters of his own.
Love is bliss! One is going to fly, with one object or
another, to the end of the earth. The earth has no ends;
and, besides, love is madness. No one can say that I do
not live happily with my wife,—she is a daughter of Last
&amp; Co., coffee-brokers. I am a member of <em>Artis</em>,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a>—she has
a shawl that cost ninety-two florins,—and yet there was never
any question between us of a foolish love like that, which
insists on living at the very end of the earth! When we
were married, we made a little tour to the Hague, she
bought some flannel there, and I am wearing under-vests
made of it to this day,—but love never drove us out into the
world any farther than that. Thus, it is all madness, and
lies together!... It is not verses alone that seduce the
young into untruthfulness. Just go into the theatre, and
listen to the falsehoods that are being spread abroad there!
The hero of the play is pulled out of the water by
some fellow on the point of going into the bankruptcy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>court. Then he gives the fellow half his fortune. That
cannot happen! Not long ago, when my hat was blown
into the Prinsengracht I gave the man who brought it back
to me twopence, and he was quite satisfied. Of course, I
know I should have had to give something more if it had
been myself that he pulled out, but certainly not half what
I possess. Why, it is quite clear that, on this principle, one
need only fall into the water twice to be ruined! But the
worst of it is, with such things represented on the stage, the
public gets so accustomed to all these falsehoods, that it
thinks them fine, and applauds them. I should just like to
throw a whole pit full of such people into the water, and see
whose applause was sincere. I, who hold by the truth, warn
every one that I am not going to pay so high a salvage for
the fishing up of my person. Any one who is not satisfied
with less, may just let me stay where I am. On a Sunday,
however, I should pay rather more, because then I wear
my gold watch-chain, and my best coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes! the stage ruins many—still more than the novels.
It looks so well! With a little gold tinsel and paper lace,
things can be made so attractive. For children, that is to
say; and for people who are not in business. Even when
they want to represent poverty on the stage, the picture given
is always a false one. A girl, whose father has gone bankrupt,
is working to keep the family. Very good! There
she sits, then, sewing, knitting, or embroidering. But just
count the stitches that she takes in the course of the whole
scene. She talks, she sighs,—she keeps running to the
window,—but she does not work. The family who can
live on such work as this, must have few wants indeed!
Of course a girl like this is the heroine. She has thrown
several villains down the stairs. She continually calls out,
“Oh! my mother! my mother!” and thus represents
virtue. What sort of a virtue do you call that, that takes
a year to finish a pair of woollen socks? Does not all this
give people wrong ideas about virtue and working for their
living?</p>

<p>“AND HE WAS QUITE SATISFIED.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Then her first lover—he was formerly a clerk at the
copying-book, but now a millionaire—suddenly comes back
and marries her. Lies again. A man with money will
never marry a girl from a house that has failed.... And
then—virtue rewarded! I have had plenty of experience
in my time; but still it shocks me terribly when I see
truth perverted in this way. Virtue rewarded! Isn’t it
just like making a traffic out of virtue? It is not so in
this world, and a very good thing it is that it is not.
Where is the merit of being virtuous, if virtue is to be
rewarded? Now, I am as virtuous as most people, but do
I expect to be rewarded for it? If my business goes on
well,—which, in fact, it does;—if my wife and children keep
in health, so that I have no worry with the doctor and
chemist;—if, year by year, I can put away a little sum for
my old age&nbsp;...;—if Fritz grows up a good man of business,
so that he can step into my shoes when I retire and go to
live at Driebergen,&nbsp;...—well, if all these things are so, I
am quite content. But all that is a natural result of circumstances,
and of my attention to business. I don’t ask
for any special reward for my virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>That I am virtuous, is quite evident from my love for
truth. This—next to my attachment to our orthodox belief—is
my ruling passion. And I should like the reader to
be quite convinced of this, because it is my excuse for
writing this book.</p>

<p class='c009'>A second passion, which rules me quite as much, is my
devotion to my business. And it is these two which have
caused me to write this book. I am now going to explain
how this happened.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>DROOGSTOPPEL PAYS A CHARITABLE VISIT.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Droogstoppel had undertaken to publish a volume selected from the
MSS. of his old schoolfellow Havelaar—<em>alias</em> “Sjaalman,”—who had
returned from the Indies in great poverty. He was preparing it for the
press with the help of his son Fritz and his German clerk Stern. He
soon found that the work involved difficulties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides the difficulty of selecting and arranging what was
necessary out of such a mass of materials, there were constantly
occurring in the MSS. words and expressions which
Stern could not understand, and which were new even to
me. They were mostly Javanese or Malay. Moreover,
many abbreviations were used, which were difficult to
decipher. I saw that we needed Sjaalman, and as I do not
think it good for a young man to pick up undesirable
acquaintances, I was unwilling to send either Stern or Fritz.
I took with me some sweets that had remained over from
our last party,—for I am always one to think of things like
that,—and I set out to look for his abode. It was not a very
brilliant one,—but there is no such thing as equality among
people, so how can they all expect to live in the same sort
of houses? He says something of the same kind himself in
his essay on “Claims to Happiness.” Besides, I don’t
think anything of people who are always discontented.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was in the Langeleidsche Dwarsstraat, in a back-room
upstairs. The ground floor was occupied by a second-hand
dealer, who sold all sorts of things—cups and saucers, furniture,
old books, glass, pictures by Van Speyk, and I don’t
know what else. I was terribly afraid of breaking something;
for in such a case the people always charge you more than
the things are worth. A little girl was sitting on the steps,
dressing her doll. I asked her whether Mr Sjaalman lived
there. She ran away, and presently her mother came.</p>

<p>“A SECOND-HAND DEALER, WHO SOLD ALL SORTS OF THINGS.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Yes, he lives here, sir. Just you go upstairs to the
first door, and then up the next floor to the next door, and
then another flight of stairs, and then you can’t miss it.
Mijntje, just run up and say there’s a gentleman. Who
shall I say is asking for them, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I told her I was Mijnheer Droogstoppel, coffee-broker in
the Lauriergracht, but that I would announce myself. I
climbed up as high as they had told me, and heard a child’s
voice singing inside the door on the third floor. I knocked,
and the door was opened by a woman—or a lady. I really
did not quite know what to make of her; she looked very
pale, and tired, and the look in her face made me think
of my wife on washing-day. She was dressed in a long
white shirt or jacket, without a waist, that hung down to her
knees, and was fastened in front with a black pin. Under
this, instead of a proper skirt or petticoat, she wore a piece
of dark flowered linen, wound round her several times, and
rather tight at hips and knees. There was no trace of folds,
width, or fulness, such as there ought to be in any decent
woman’s dress. I was glad I had not sent Fritz, for I
thought her costume very indelicate; and what made it still
stranger was the ease with which she moved—as if she felt
quite comfortable like that. The creature seemed quite
unconscious that she did not look like other women.
Moreover, she did not seem in the least embarrassed at my
coming. She hid nothing under the table, and did not
push the chairs about, or do any of the things you always
see people do when a respectably dressed stranger comes in.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had her hair combed back like a Chinese, and
fastened behind her head in a sort of twist or knot. I have
heard since that her dress was a sort of Indian costume,
which they call <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sarong</span></i> and <em>kaabai</em> out there, but I thought
the whole thing very ugly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you Juffrouw Sjaalman?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A LONG WHITE SHIRT OR JACKET.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Whom have I the honour of speaking to?” she said, in
a tone that seemed to convey that I ought to have said
something about <em>honour</em> too.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well—I don’t hold with compliments. A principal is a
different matter, and I have been in business long enough
to know what I am about; but I didn’t think it necessary
to use much ceremony in a third-floor back. So I said,
without more ado, that I was Mijnheer Droogstoppel, coffee-broker,
Lauriergracht, No. 37, and I wanted to see her
husband. Well—and why should I have made any more
fuss about it?</p>

<p class='c009'>She offered me a rush-bottomed chair, and took a little
girl on her lap, who was sitting on the ground playing. The
little boy, whom I had heard singing, looked full at me, and
stared at me from top to toe. He, too, did not seem in the
least embarrassed. He was a little chap of about six, as
queerly dressed as his mother. He had on a wide pair of
knickerbockers that did not come down to the knees; and
his legs were bare from there to the ankle. Very indecent,
I think. “Have you come to talk to papa?” he asked, in
a way which showed me at once that his upbringing was not
at all what it ought to be. But because I did not quite
know what attitude to take up, and also wanted to talk a
little, I answered, “Yes, my little fellow, I want to talk to
your papa. Do you think he will be coming in soon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know; he’s gone out to look for some money to
buy me a paint-box.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, my boy,” said the woman. “Play with the
pictures a little, or with your Chinese puzzle-box.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you know the gentleman came and took all the
things away yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So that was the way he spoke to his mother—h’m!&nbsp;...
and there had been “a gentleman,” it appeared, to “take
everything away.”&nbsp;... Cheerful visit, this! The woman,
too, did not look in good spirits; she turned away and
wiped her eyes, when she thought I could not see her, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>she put the little girl down on the floor beside her brother.
“There,” she said, “now play with Nonnie a little.” An
extraordinary name for a child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Juffrouw,” I asked, “do you expect your husband
in soon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot say for certain,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this the little boy suddenly left his sister, came up to
me, and asked,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, why do you call mamma Juffrouw?”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what then, youngster?” said I, “what ought I to
say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why&nbsp;... just like other people. The Juffrouw lives
downstairs—she sells saucers and tops.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Well—I am a coffee-broker—Last &amp; Co., Lauriergracht,
37—there are thirteen of us in the counting-house, and, if
you count Stern, who gets no salary, fourteen. And yet my
wife is simply called <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Juffrouw</span></i>; and does any one expect me
to go and say <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mevrouw</span></i> to <em>that</em> person? Certainly not.
Every one ought to keep his place; and what’s more, the
sheriff’s officers had been there the day before, and taken
away the furniture. So I thought it quite the proper thing
to say <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Juffrouw</span></i>, and stuck to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I asked why Sjaalman has not come to my house to fetch
back his parcel. She seemed to know all about it, and said
that they had been away—at Brussels. He had been
writing for the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Indépendance</span></cite> there, but had been obliged to
give it up, because the paper had so often been refused
admission into France on account of his articles. They had
returned to Amsterdam a few days since, because Sjaalman
had heard of a situation there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At Gaafzuiger’s, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, that was the name. But it had come to nothing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>after all, she said. Well, I knew more about that than she
did. He had dropped the bound volume of <cite>Aglaia</cite>, and he
was lazy, pedantic, and in bad health&nbsp;... just so; that was
why they discharged him.</p>

<p class='c009'>She added that he meant to come and see me one of
these days,—perhaps he was even now on his way to my
house,—to ask me for an answer to the request he had made
to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said that he could come when it suited him, but that he
was not to ring the bell, because that gives the servant so
much trouble. If he waited a little, I told her, some one
would be sure to come out sooner or later, and he could go
in then. And then I departed, taking my sweets with me,
for, to tell the truth, I didn’t like the look of things at all.
I did not feel at my ease there. Why, a coffee-broker is not
a crossing-sweeper, or a street-porter, I should think; and I
am sure I look respectable enough. I had on my fur-lined
overcoat, and yet she sat there as calmly, and talked as unconcernedly
to her children, as if she had been alone. Besides,
she seemed to have been crying, and if there is anything I
cannot put up with, it is discontented people. Besides, it
was chilly and unsociable in the place,—I suppose, because
the furniture had been taken,—and I like a room to look
cosy and comfortable. As I was going home, I thought I
would try and keep on my old clerk Bastiaans a little
longer,—because, after all, I don’t like turning a man into
the street.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Now I am going to tell you how humility came into the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'><i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Pygmee</span></i> was small of stature, and liked looking over other
people’s heads. In which he was seldom successful, because
he was so very small.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went on a journey to look for people smaller than
himself, but he could not find them. And his longing to
look down on them became more and more intolerable.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last he came to Patagonia, where people are so tall that
even the children just born look down on their fathers.</p>

<p class='c009'><i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Pygmee</span></i> did not like this—in other people. But in his
despair of finding any smaller than himself, he bethought
himself of a plan. He invented a virtue, which proclaimed
as its first principle, “<em>Whosoever is taller than Pygmee must
stoop till he comes within Pygmee’s line of vision</em>,”—and the
novelty made its way. All the Patagonians became virtuous.
When any one, by walking upright, sinned against the “first
principles” of Pygmee’s virtue, he was punished in a peculiar
way. Every one who was bowed down and virtuous
jumped up and caught him round the neck till his head
reached the level of Patagonian good conduct. And the
man who was strong enough to carry all Patagonia on his
shoulders, without becoming virtuous, was set in the pillory,
with a collar round his neck, and a word inscribed thereon
in the Patagonian tongue, which, being literally translated,
signifies—</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>OF EDUCATION, WITH PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>... I am positively forced to tell you that I think
Dominie Pennewip’s lot might have been counted an extenuating
circumstance had he been convicted of eight deadly
sins at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have noticed that a considerable number of great men
began their careers as swineherds (see all biographical
dictionaries); and it seems, therefore, as if this employment
called out the elements of all the qualities needed to govern
men—or to enlighten them. Which is not quite the same
thing....</p>

<p class='c009'>... As for comparing human beings and pigs, let the
reader remember the connection between coal and diamonds,
and every one will be satisfied—even the theologians!</p>

<p class='c009'>But, since making this observation on the splendid prospects
which await any one who has spent his tender youth
in the society of the grunting coal-diamonds of the animal
kingdom, I have several times thought it strange that, in the
biographies of great men, there should be so few examples
of ex-schoolmasters. For, after all, all the elements which
seem to constitute a pig-pasture the nursery of genius are
abundantly present in the schoolroom.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reverse process frequently occurs. Every day we see
exiled princes giving instruction to idle youth. Dionysius
and Louis Philippe are not the only ones; and I myself
have attempted to teach French to an American. Which
proved impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>If elective monarchies should come into fashion again, I
should like to see the people’s choice confine itself, by
preference, to persons who had studied mankind from
models in miniature, just as one learns geography from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>portable globes and atlases. All virtues, inclinations, passions,
errors, misdeeds,—all points which have to be studied
in human society,—are found in a small and comprehensive
scale on the benches of the school; and the boasted diplomacy
of many a statesman only amounts, when looked at
carefully, to the tricks of which our Machiavels of three feet
high make the warp and woof of their tactics.</p>

<p class='c009'>The schoolmaster’s profession is not an easy one; and I
have never understood why it is so poorly paid, or, since it
seems that this is an inexorable law of nature, how it is that
people are always found to fill it, instead of drawing the
same pay as drill-instructors, and showing soldiers how
to load their guns, which is less perplexing to the mind, and
gives you more fresh air, with oxygen in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or else, I should prefer to be a minister. For the latter
has to do with people who are quite at one with him as to
the matter in hand, and come and listen to him of their
own free choice; while the teacher has to keep up a constant
fight with reluctance on the part of the pupils, and also with
a highly dangerous set of rivals, in the shape of tops,
marbles, and paper dolls—not to mention sweets, changing
teeth, scarlet fever, and weak mothers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pennewip was a man of the old school,—at least so he
would appear to us if we saw him now-a-days, in his grey coat,
long waistcoat, and knee-breeches with buckles, the whole
figure crowned with a brown wig, which he was constantly
pushing hither and thither, and which was always curled just
so at the beginning of the week—if there was no rain in
the air. For curls cannot stand damp; and it was on Sundays
that the man came with the curling-tongs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet the <em>old-fashionedness</em> is, perhaps, only relative. Who
knows whether it was not counted new-fangled in its day; or
how soon the same thing may be said of us. However that
may be, the man was addressed as “<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">meester</span></i>,” and his school
was called a <em>school</em>, and not an <em>institution</em>. In his school,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>where, according to the simple fashion of the time, boys and
girls sat side by side, you learned—or you could learn, if so
minded—reading, arithmetic, writing, the history of your
own country, psalm-singing, wool-work, knitting, marking,
and religion. All this was in the ordinary curriculum; but
any pupil who particularly distinguished him or herself by
talent, application, or obedience, received, over and above,
lessons in verse-making,—an art wherein the soul of Dominie
Pennewip greatly delighted. He “finished” the boys to the
point of complete fitness for “acceptance”;<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and, with the
help of his wife, brought the girls the length of a sampler,
with a red text on a black ground, or a spitted heart between
two flowerpots. Then their education was complete, and
they were quite fit, if so minded, to become the grandmothers
of our present generation of citizens.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The school was empty, and the forms looked as though
the pupils had left all their weariness behind them there.
The map of Europe looked ill-temperedly down on the pile
of copy-books, next to which lay the quill pens, worn down
to the gums, so to speak, in the pot-hooks and hangers
which have opened the gate of access to all learning so long
that the memory of man goeth not to the contrary. The
difficult sum in fractions was still visible, in all its glory, on
the blackboard; but yet, the school was no school; its spirit
had fled—it was a corpse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, the informing mind had departed with the children.
For that these carried about with them a large quantity of
the above article shall speedily be made evident.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the great day on which Dominie Pennewip was to
judge of the fruits of his pupils’ poetic genius. There he
sat. His much-moved wig shared in the emotions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>filled him on reading the poems; and we will be indiscreet
enough to look over his shoulder, so as, in our turn, to be
touched by impressions of never-sufficiently-to-be-appreciated
artistic enjoyment.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Dominie Pennewip could not trust his own eyes. He
turned the sheet over and looked at the back, to see if the
Virtue he had given Wouter as a subject was hidden there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas, alas! there was no trace of virtue in Wouter’s composition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor wig!</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes—poor wig! For after having made it to undergo
what no wig ever underwent before,—after having tugged,
plucked, ill-used, and tormented it to an extent which would
have taken more than the imagination of the whole De
Wilde family to conceive,—Dominie Pennewip tore it from
his head, doubled it up between his convulsively clenched
hands,—stammered, “Heaven and earth! Gracious goodness!
where in nature did he pick that up?”—banged it
down on his head again, clapped his venerable three-cornered
hat atop of it, and flew out of the front door like
a man possessed. He went straight to the Pieterses’ house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Juffrouw Pieterse, Wouter’s mother, had been entertaining
a few of her friends and neighbours at a “little evening,”
with tea and cake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good evening, Juffrouw Pieterse; I am your obedient
servant. I see you have company,—but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mention it, sir! Just come in and sit down!...
Will you take a cup with us—sage-milk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Juffrouw Pieterse,” replied the master, solemnly, “I did
not come here to drink sage-milk!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But please sit down, Dominie——”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not easy, under the circumstances, but the ladies
shifted their chairs a little, and the Dominie was finally installed
in his. He was coughing with overwhelming seriousness.
He looked round on the company, drew out a roll
of papers, pulled his wig to one side, and spoke:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Juffrouw Pieterse! you are an honest, respectable
woman,—and your late husband—sold shoes——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Juffrouw Pieterse cast on Juffrouw Laps a glance of vindictive
triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“Yes, sir, he did!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t interrupt me, Juffrouw Pieterse. Your deceased
consort sold shoes. I have had your children at my school,
from the time when they were <em>so</em> high, to their confirmation.
Is not that true, Juffrouw Pieterse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” she replied, somewhat uneasily, for she began
to be frightened at the impressive solemnity of Pennewip’s
tone. “Yes, that’s true, Dominie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I ask you, Juffrouw Pieterse, whether you, so long
as you, through the means of your children, have had anything
to do with my school, have had any complaints—I
mean, well-founded complaints, Juffrouw Pieterse—to make
of the way in which I—with the help of my wife—have
given your numerous offspring instruction in reading, writing,
arithmetic, Dutch history, psalm-singing, sewing, knitting,
marking, and religion? That is what I ask you,
Juffrouw Pieterse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A ghastly silence. The neighbour in the back-room
downstairs, who had repeatedly complained of the noise
during the evening, had every reason to be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is what I ask you, Juffrouw Pieterse,” repeated
the Dominie, putting on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pince-nez</span></i>, which was considered
antiquated in those days—destined, as it was, to become
the height of fashion some decades later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Dominie——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No buts, Juffrouw Pieterse. I ask of you—or I ask
you,—for it is quite allowable, Juffrouw Pieterse, in this
case, to omit the preposition,—I ask you if you have any
complaints to make—I mean, of course, well-founded complaints—of
the instruction given by me in reading,
writing——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goodness, no, Dominie!—I have no complaints;
but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that so? No complaints? Well, then, I declare to
you—— Where is your son Wouter?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Wouter? Why—oh! he went out, so he did! Hasn’t
he come in yet, Trui? Wouter is out for a walk, Dominie,
with the little Hallemans—very nicely-behaved children,
Dominie,—and they live——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh! what?—with the Hallemans, is he?—the Hallemans
who go to the French school? oh! indeed—yes!
So it’s from the Hallemans he learns such things—it must
be——... loose morals&nbsp;... utter depravity&nbsp;... the
French school...! Well, in short, Juffrouw Pieterse,—I
say that your son——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you that your son Wouter——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—what has Wouter been doing now?” asked
Juffrouw Laps, rejoiced, pious person that she was, at the
new misdeed she was to hear of.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as Pennewip was about to open the indictment, there
was another ring at the bell,—and the unfortunate delinquent
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Juffrouw Pieterse,” Pennewip began, “my school is
known as a good school even so far off as Kattenburg<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a>—do
you hear that, and understand it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes, Dominie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I repeat it,—well known; and more especially so on
account of the good moral tone which prevails there,—I
mean, of course, in my school. Religion and virtue are
put foremost. I could show you verses on such subjects
that—but I will pass over that for the present. Let it
suffice you to know that my school is known as far as&nbsp;...
what do I say?—I have even taught the son of a resident
in Wittenburg,<a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a>—a block-maker he was—and once, indeed,
I was consulted in writing as to what was to be done with a
boy whose father lived no nearer than Muiderberg!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, Dominie!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Yes, Juffrouw Pieterse! I am still in possession of the
letter—which I could show you if I chose; the man was a
sexton, and the youth had fallen into a sad habit of drawing
unseemly figures on the tombstones—but just on that
account—I mean for the sake of the religion and virtue for
which I am so well known—I feel it my duty to take this
opportunity of informing you that I do not choose to see
the good name of my school ruined by means of that good-for-nothing
rascal of a son of yours, who stands there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Wouter was aghast. That sounded very unlike the
appointment he had been dreaming of—brigand-in-chief to
the Pope of Rome,—which, however, he no longer desired,
having thought of a different position which would suit him
better.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mother was about to proceed to what she called
“<em>her</em> religion,” and administer chastisement on the spot, in
order to satisfy the Dominie, and show him that, in her
house, too, religion and sound morals had the first place.
But the schoolmaster thought it better to inform the company
what was toward, and thereby bring the culprit to a
deeper sense of his delinquencies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your son, Juffrouw Pieterse, belongs to the class of
robbers, murderers, and fire-raisers!”&nbsp;...</p>

<p class='c009'>No more than that!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracious goodness! Merciful justice! What next!
Oh! my gracious patience! How is it possible? What
human beings have to endure!” Something like this—for
I will not answer for textual accuracy—was the flood of
exclamations which overwhelmed the ten-year-old robber,
murderer, and fire-raiser. Poor Wouter!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will read you a piece in his own handwriting,” said
the Dominie, “and any one who, after this, can still doubt
the utter depravity of this boy——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole company promised with one voice not to
doubt it. The poem, indeed, which Master Pennewip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>thereupon proceeded to read, was of a kind which rendered
doubt on that head very difficult; and I myself, though I
have chosen Wouter as my hero, shall not find it easy to
convince the reader that he was not so bad as would appear
from his atrocious—</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>GOING INTO BUSINESS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The plan of “going into business” was quite attractive to
Wouter. Perhaps because he did not quite know what it
meant. He asked his brother Stoffel about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—don’t you understand <em>that</em>? ‘In business’
means the same thing as—as being a merchant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what shall I have to sell? And how shall I know
what people want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you must not imagine that you will have to go
about with a peddler’s pack, and ring at people’s front doors
to know if they want to buy anything. You’re a stupid;
you never will understand anything. ‘In business,’ you
see, means—it means——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stoffel began to stammer. He was not the first to
stumble over a definition—and will not be the last.
But there are few who, in such a case, have an ally at home
to help them out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can you always talk such nonsense, Wouter?”
cried his mother. “There’s Stoffel, now, explaining everything
to you so clearly, and there you are again making out
you don’t understand. Who in the world ever told you
that you would have to go about the street with a pack on
your back, like an oilman or a <em>mersan de la perreplu</em>?<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Is
that what I have brought you up for, and made you take
the highest place in the school? You are an ungrateful
child. What is the good of your knowing so much, and
being able to make such fine letters, with curls and flourishes
to them, if you must insult your own mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Readers who care anything for justice, will find it strange,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and perhaps unfair, that Wouter should have been overwhelmed
with this flood of reproach. Unfair? Certainly!
But—strange? Why, no! I solemnly affirm my accuracy
in depicting a certain manner of carrying on a controversy,
of which Juffrouw Pieterse was unquestionably mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now, supposing Wouter had, in all humility, remarked
that he had given no occasion for the above sermon? Well,
in that case he would have been overwhelmed with a second
lecture on the far-reaching and infamous wickedness of being
in the right, which, indeed, under certain circumstances, <em>is</em> a
fault—and a bad one.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Professor of Ichthyology was delivering his lecture.
The students were listening—well, pretty attentively as
students go—not to mention students of <em>Ichthyology</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The carp, gentlemen, the carp——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then followed some facts about the carp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now the carp, gentlemen, as I was saying——”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment a carp came swimming into the lectureroom.
How the beast did it, considering how dry it was
there, does not concern us. The poor students had suffered
from drought for ever so long,—and, after all, a carp is no
better than a student.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There he is himself!” they cried, with one voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they left the professor in the lurch with his lecture on
the carp, and went to look at the carp for themselves.
Now I think this quite right and natural on the part of the
students. But I wish we could do the same, and try to
look at men—and women too—for ourselves, instead of
listening to somebody’s dicta about Man!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>EGOTISM.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“You talk a great deal about yourself,” say many who
never get talked about, either by themselves or other people.
“This is against the tone of good society.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I advise you to seek better society than mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You talk a great deal about yourself——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Would you prefer me to speak of you,&nbsp;... or
your cat,&nbsp;... or your dog,&nbsp;... or your ass?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Do you wish that? Well, content yourself, I have often
done so, but you did not know it at the time, because you
are always confusing yourself with your neighbour’s donkey.
Your neighbour has also been complaining; he says that I
have been all the time talking about <em>your</em> donkeys. Compensation!
The donkeys themselves have never complained,
the good, dumb beasts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You talk a great deal about yourself——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I want to be honest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You talk a great deal about yourself——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I am my own latest love. I had loved long, and
often, and ardently, before <em>that</em> love was born. But now
that it does exist,&nbsp;... and is the last....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You talk a great deal about yourself——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“Yes. If it wearies you, what hinders your exchanging
me for the <cite>Aglaia</cite>? What hinders your becoming a subscriber
to ‘The Life, Fortunes, and Business of the Kappelman
Family’—in one vol., cloth gilt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You talk a great deal about yourself——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite so. When you do what Havelaar did, and the
rich young man in Matthew xix. did <em>not</em> do, I will talk about
you.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE STORY OF CHRESOS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Chresos lived in Bœotia. By profession he was mayor of
a little village, whose name I do not know, neither can I tell
you how he had strayed into Bœotia, since his family
belonged to Athens—nay, I think he was even related to
Alcibiades, who was a Frenchman born too soon. Chresos
was a good sort of man, and lived contentedly. He looked
after his village as well as he could, and amused himself,
in his spare hours, by playing on the lute; but he only did
this at home, and never annoyed any one with his music.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, behold, there came robbers, who ill-treated the inhabitants
of the village over which Chresos had authority.
He laid aside his lute, and tried to drive the robbers away;
but he was told that he ought not to have done this, because
the robbers were under the protection of the magistrates in
the capital.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chresos did not believe this, because it seemed to him
too bad to be credible. He continued to resist the robbers,
and, their force being too great for him, he sent a messenger
to Thebes, to ask for help.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of help, he received for answer, that he was an
unworthy mayor, and entirely incompetent to fill any office
in Bœotia. He did not attempt to deny this. After having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>advised his villagers to have patience, he left the place with
his wife and children, taking nothing with him but his
lute. His house was occupied by a new mayor, who, it may
be supposed, was less unworthy, in the opinion of the Theban
magistrates, and who, also, seemed to be on very good terms
with the very robbers whom the stupid Chresos had wanted
to exterminate. At any rate, there were no more complaints
of violence, although the robbers still remained in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>With difficulty, Chresos obtained access to the Areopagus,
and related what had happened to him. He pointed to his
family, who were perishing of want—through a misunderstanding
on the part of the magistrates; for he still thought
that the whole matter arose out of a misunderstanding. I
have already told you that he was not really a Bœotian by
birth. This was why he held such mistaken opinions.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Areopagus took no notice. Chresos asked his
wife to have patience, which was not necessary, and consoled
himself by playing the lute. He was no great musician,
but there is something peculiar in the playing of a father
who sees his family starving; this was why they listened to
him, not because Chresos played well. There was something
that tickled coarse ears. There were many coarse
ears in Bœotia.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they said, “Well played, Chresos; go on,” his hand
fell limply down, and the tears stood in his eyes at the
thought that this undesired praise was the price of his
children’s hunger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet he played from time to time, because he could do no
other. And his family bore their hunger patiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again and again he appealed to the Areopagus. At last
he received the following answer:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Court of Areopagus, &amp;c., having heard the complaints
of the ex-mayor Chresos as to the outrages in the
village of——, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“HE PLAYED FROM TIME TO TIME.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Having likewise heard his request for a decision between
him and the Theban magistrates, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And whereas the said Chresos declares that he and his
family are in a position of great distress, in consequence of
a misunderstanding which induced the said magistrates to
take the side of the robbers who plundered the village,</p>

<p class='c009'>“And whereas, moreover, many witnesses declare that
they have heard the said Chresos playing on the lute,</p>

<p class='c009'>“In pursuance of, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sentence of the Court is, that the said Chresos
continue playing on the lute, and pay all costs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Areopagus had been bribed,—and its name was
<span class='sc'>Holland</span>.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE FAIRY TALE THAT FANCY TOLD WOUTER.</em><br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Fancy’s Fairy Tale.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wouter had found out that he was a prince. His
princedom lay in the region of the moon&nbsp;... no, much
farther off than that.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is how he came to it:—</p>

<p class='c009'>Long before the beginning of this story,—yes, very, very
long ago, there was a Queen of Spirits, just as in <em>Hans
Heiling</em>. Her name was A—OO.</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not live in a cave, as did the one in <em>Hans</em>, but
held her court far above the clouds, which is more airy, and
also more fitting for a queen.</p>

<p class='c009'>She wore a necklace of stars, and a sun was set in her
signet-ring.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she went out, the nebulæ flew up like dust, and
she scattered the firmaments with a stroke of her fan.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>
<img src='images/i_120.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“HER NAME WAS A—OO.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Her children played with planets for marbles, and complained
that they were so hard to find when they rolled
away among the furniture. This made Prince Upsilon—the
queen’s little son—very cross, and he kept asking for
some other kind of toys.</p>

<p class='c009'>The queen had a box full of Sirii given him, but in a
little while these too were lost. But that was Upsilon’s own
fault. He ought to have taken better care of his playthings.
People did what they could to content him. But
whatever was given him, he kept calling for something else—something
more and bigger. This was a fault in the
little prince’s character.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mother, who, as Queen of Spirits, was a very sensible
woman, understood that it would be a good thing for the
youngster to get accustomed to <em>doing without</em> for a little.
So she said that Upsilon was to be left without any playthings
at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was done. They took away everything from him,—even
the comet with which he and his little sister
Omicron were playing at battledore and shuttlecock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prince Upsilon was of a passionate temper, and so far
forgot himself as to say something very disrespectful about
his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Princess Omicron, too, led astray by his example (for
nothing is more ruinous than bad examples), angrily threw
her battledore at the Universe. Which was not nice in a
little girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now in the kingdom of Spirits there was a law that
whoever lost sight of the respect due to the Queen, or threw
anything at the Universe, should be punished for the same
by a temporary loss of all rank and dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prince Upsilon became a grain of sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>After having behaved well for a couple of thousand years,
he received the joyful tidings that he was promoted to the
rank of a tuft of moss.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>In this capacity he kept his duty in mind, and did everything
that a good moss tuft ought to do. And on a certain
morning he awoke as a polype.</p>

<p class='c009'>This happened about the time when human beings first
began to prepare their food by means of fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>He built one or two continents, and in about two
thousand years’ time he was rewarded for his zeal by being
changed into a shrimp.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this position, also, no one had the slightest reason to
complain of his conduct, and in due course he was transferred
to the class of sea-serpents.</p>

<p class='c009'>He amused himself, innocently enough, by playing at
hide-and-seek with the sailors, but did no one any harm;
and some time afterwards he received four feet and the rank
of mastodon, with the privilege of disporting himself on
shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>With philosophic calm he adapted himself to his new
circumstances, and occupied himself with geological observations.
A few million ages later....</p>

<p class='c009'>When I speak of ages, it must be borne in mind that all
this time taken together was only a short quarter of an hour
in the land of Spirits,&nbsp;... or rather that it was absolutely
nothing. For <em>time</em> was invented for the convenience of
mankind, as we give spelling-books to children. For Spirits,
<em>then</em>, <em>now</em>, and <em>in the future</em> is exactly the same thing. They
comprehend <em>yesterday</em>, <em>to-day</em>, and <em>to-morrow</em> in one glance,—just
as we read a word without spelling. What <em>was</em> and
<em>shall be</em>, <em>is</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Egyptians and Phœnicians knew this very well, but
we seem to have forgotten it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few million years later, then, he rose to the rank of an
elephant; and, a spirit-minute or so after that,—that is ten
years, I mean human years this time—before the beginning
of my story, he was transferred to the class of human beings.</p>

<p class='c009'>What he had done amiss, as an elephant, I do not know.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>But, <span class='sc'>Fancy</span> had said, if he did not want to be put back
another step, instead of being shortly restored to his rank as
a prince of Spirits, he must look to his ways as a human
being; not make any more verses about brigands, or sell
any more Bibles; and then, why, perhaps it might come to
pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas, he would have to put up with Juffrouw Pieterse’s not
wearing a train. “That,” said Fancy, “is so, and can’t be
helped.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fancy appeared to be a sort of maid-of-honour of
Wouter’s mother, who came to visit him in his banishment,
so as to cheer him up a bit, and tell him to take courage,
for the temporary punishment that had fallen to his lot did
not mean that people had ceased to love him.</p>

<p class='c009'>She promised to come and see him from time to time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” Wouter had asked, “how is my little sister?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your sister has been punished too—you know the law.
But she is a dear child. She is submitting to it patiently,
and promises to do better in the future. In the beginning
she was a bubble of air, and conducted herself irreproachably
as such. Then she became a moonbeam, and in this
capacity also no one had any fault to find with her. She
shone so that it was a pleasure to see her, and your mother
had need of all her strength of mind to keep from granting
her a respite. So she was soon promoted to be a perfume,
and filled the Universe to such a degree that she gave us a
headache. This happened about the time when you were
beginning to eat grass. Then she became a butterfly. But
your mother found that this was not a suitable position for
a girl, and therefore soon changed her into a constellation—see,
there she is—below us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Wouter looked for Omicron, but could not find her.</p>

<p class='c009'>It often happens that we miss something because it is too
big.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See,” said Fancy, “there—to the right—no—rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>farther off—there—there—the Pole Star. That’s her left
eye. You can’t see the right, because she is stooping after
Orion, her doll. She is holding him on her lap and playing
with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Wouter now saw her clearly, and cried “Omicron!
Omicron!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” said the maid-of-honour, “that won’t do,
prince. The queen expressly directed that your confinement
was to be on the cellular system. It is only as a great
favour that you two are shut up within the same universe.
When your brothers spoilt the Milky Way some time ago by
letting floods loose over it, they were put very much farther
apart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Wouter was greatly grieved at this. He would so have
liked to kiss all those stars, with the doll in their lap, which
were his little sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Fancy,” he cried, “do let me be with Omicron!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fancy said neither yes nor no. There was something in
her manner as if she were thinking over the possibility of
bringing a very difficult matter to pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Wouter, taking courage from her hesitation, repeated
his prayer:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! let me be with my little sister. I don’t mind if I
have to eat grass again, or build continents. I will do my
very best at it, if I may only be with Omicron!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems as though Fancy were afraid to promise what
might be out of her power, and, at the same time, that it
pained her not to be able to give the promise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will ask,” she whispered; “and now....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Wouter rubbed his eyes&nbsp;... he was standing on the
little bridge over the canal.</p>

or the most savage tiger!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> The fellow never will learn to understand that a

official honour, which involves him in the constant risk of
incurring a thrashing.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> But what has happened, after all? Surely,
gentlemen, you did not come running here in such haste to
tell me that you got into quod last year?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> What has happened? Nothing, strictly speaking&nbsp;... but a whole lot <em>may</em> happen.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> And that must be prevented,—and that is why we
have come to seek comfort, counsel, and help from the
hospitable Fournichon.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> I’ll tell you all about it. We were just coming
quietly and comfortably from lecture together, when we
passed a baker’s shop, when the servant girl was just washing
the windows. John took it into his head that we might lend
a hand, and I seized a pail of water, intending to throw the
contents at the window, when the pail itself slipped from my
hands, and flew right through the plate-glass window into
the middle of the currant-buns and cakes! Unhappily, the
aforesaid incorruptible policeman just happened to be in the
neighbourhood, so that he caught us red-handed, and we had
to make good use of our legs to escape being locked up at once.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> You will understand that we did not intend any
mischief,—it was a harmless joke, which turned out badly.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Of course. And not only so, but there was
provocation on the baker’s part. If he had chosen another
time of day to have his windows cleaned, it could not
possibly have turned out so. In any case, there are plenty
of extenuating circumstances, and I don’t understand why
you gentlemen should have such a violent objection to a day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>or two under lock and key. That happens often enough,
and young gentlemen don’t usually think so much of it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> That is true, but to-day is an extraordinary occasion.
We were going to the fancy-dress ball to-night, and should
be very sorry to miss it. So you see us in a fearful scrape,
with a gendarme at our heels, and you must help us. [<em>A
ring at the bell.</em>] What’s that?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> I don’t know; we shall see in a minute.
[<em>Steps are heard coming up the stairs.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> John, get out of sight. [<em>They hide.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pierre</em> (<em>entering</em>). Sir, Vrouw Krullemie has just sold her
hair this morning for seventy-five cents.</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>The students come out again.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Bother your Krullemie! Say, Fournichon, if your
visitors are in the habit of dropping in unannounced after
this fashion, we are not altogether safe here.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Well, look here, gentlemen, you suggested an
idea yourselves. Your costumes for the ball must be quite
ready by this time; why don’t you disguise yourselves in
them?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> A fine lark! In the first place they are not here....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> That would matter less, for we might send for them,
but we could scarcely show ourselves in the streets in them.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> How so?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Well, I was going to appear as the Avenger of Innocence.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> And I as the Four Seasons.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> You are right, that would never do; but I
have another proposal to make. I too intend going to the ball,
and have had costumes made for myself and one of my
friends, which will no doubt suit you better. You can have
those, and give us yours.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> All right, if they are better suited to the purpose
than ours.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Oh! just perfect! You shall see. [<em>Opens two

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> I am quite lost in this cap.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><em>Fournichon.</em> You must have a wig on first.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Just look here, Fournichon, this dress isn’t long
enough.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Why, of course, you’re only in short skirts as
yet.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Ah! is that it?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> John, don’t I look charming?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Quite enchanting! If you were my grandmother, I
should certainly fall in love with you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> Where’s my wig?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Here are plenty, just choose one for yourself.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> These curls are what will suit me. [<em>Puts on the
wig, and a round straw hat on the top of it.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> This grey one will just do for me. [<em>Puts it
on, and then the cap.</em>] Now, I’m ready! Sapristi! How
hot it is. There’s the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Good gracious, now we’ve got it!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Quiet now; sit down before it’s too late.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> What’s the good of that? our voices will betray us.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> You must not talk. Just you trust to me,
and it will be all right.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> When I was with the First regiment, and
was three times wounded in two battles.... Ah! good-morning,
Mr Hairdresser&nbsp;... three times wounded,—it
would never have happened to me to let two scoundrels
escape. Never!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> What’s your pleasure, Mr—Mr——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Bom de Sac, if you please—with the Third
regiment—in four battles, five wounds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span><em>Fournichon.</em> Does M. Bom de Sac want his hair cut?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Many thanks, I always do that myself. I
learnt that with the Fourth&nbsp;... when I was six times
wounded in five battles. But, sir, that is not the point at
present. I was just going to say that this morning two
scoundrels——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Scoundrels?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Scoundrels, or students, whichever you like
to call them.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Well, and what did they do?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Just imagine, sir. I was at the baker’s, and
the maid was standing on a ladder outside cleaning the
window, when two good-for-nothing vagabonds came up,
took up a pail of water, and threw it at the girl, and the
girl fell right through the window in among the currant-buns!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Not killed, I hope.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> No, the buns had broken her fall. But I
was out of the house in a flash, and after the fellows. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacré
nom de guerre!</span></i> if I could still run as I could when I was in
the Fifth&nbsp;... and wounded seven times in six battles&nbsp;...
they would never have escaped me! But they are here!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Have a glass?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> If you please. [<em>Drinks.</em>] Thank you. I am
told they came into this house, and if so, they’ll have to
come out, sir!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Here! How is it possible? You are quite
free to search the room if you like. These ladies are my
grandmother and my cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac</em> (<em>seeing them for the first time, salutes</em>). Ah!
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honneur aux dames</span></i>, as we used to say in the Sixth. I hope
you won’t mind, ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> You need not give yourself the trouble of
speaking to them. The old lady is stone deaf, and won’t
understand a word, and she watches over her granddaughter
so carefully that she cannot bear to see a gentleman speak
to the girl, because she cannot hear what he is saying.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Just look here, Monsieur Bom de Sac, could

Both of them have white hats.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac</em> (<em>rushing to the window</em>). Where?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Ah! what a pity! they have just this moment
gone round the corner towards the Botermarkt.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> White hats, you say? The devil!—that must
be they, and they shan’t escape me this time. [<em>Exit.</em>] It’s
not for nothing that I had ten wounds in nine battles when
serving with the Eighth.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> Bad luck to the fellow! he has made it warm for
us!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> If it had lasted any longer, I am sure I should have
made some remarks on my own account. If some one else
comes, we really must find some other place, for I really
can’t sit still so long in these blessed skirts.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> Shall we stand up then?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Why not. [<em>Jumps on one of the chests.</em>] Look here,
I’ll bet you anything you like I can stand half-an-hour like
this without moving. Don’t I look like a waxwork figure of
summer?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> The devil you are! [<em>Gets on the other chest.</em>]
And I winter, to match.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Splendid, gentlemen, it couldn’t be finer.
Just stand still like that. [<em>A ring at the bell.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles</em> (<em>getting down</em>). Preserve us!—now we’re in for it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> No, Charles, stick to your post.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> I can’t possibly stand still all that time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><em>Fournichon.</em> It won’t be necessary. Just stand in any
easy attitude, and you can change your position quietly from

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> Good-day, Monsieur Fournichon. Good-day,
ladies. (<em>To Fournichon.</em>) Why are you laughing?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> At your taking those waxworks for ladies.
Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> Waxworks, you say! How astonishingly lifelike!
It’s true, though, it would be a queer position for living
beings to stand in.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Well done, are they not? It is an allegorical
representation of winter and summer.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> Very pretty, very pretty indeed! You hair-dressers
have always something curious on hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> That’s to say, sir, they are not my property.
They have been sent to me to look after the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffures</span></i>, and
they are to go to London,—to Madame Tousseau’s museum.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> Oh, indeed!—indeed! Well, art has made great
strides.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Great strides, sir! You’re quite right there.
Just feel now—elastic as india-rubber—quite like a human
being.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> Wonderful! wonderful! But I am in a hurry—can
you shave me?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Certainly, sir, sit down! [<em>Gives him a chair
between John and Charles, but rather more towards the back
of the shop. Goes on shaving him, and talking at the same

<p class='c017'>[<em>John changes his position.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span><em>Meijer</em> (<em>starting up</em>). Good heavens!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> No need to be uneasy, sir; there is nothing
really dangerous.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> No, that’s not what I was thinking of,—but that
doll of yours—the summer one—is moving!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Oh! that is nothing surprising—perhaps I
stepped on the floor rather heavily. You must know these
figures are full of steel springs inside, and the slightest
vibration makes them move. Just look now!</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Stamps on the floor. John and Charles immediately
change their positions.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> Ah! thank you for your explanation. I really
never should have understood it.</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Sits down again, and Fournichon goes on shaving him
till he has finished. Meijer rises.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> Thanks. Can you give me change?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> I’ll go and get it.</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Exit. Meijer goes to look at the waxworks.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Meijer.</em> They <em>are</em> curious, though! I have often seen waxworks
before, but never so graceful, so lifelike as these.
Whenever any one stamps on the floor, they move. [<em>Stamps—John
and Charles again change their attitudes.</em>] Just look
at that! how pretty! Once more! Sublime! And that’s
the way they keep on! [<em>Stamps again, and continues to do so,
faster and faster—John and Charles changing their position
with every stamp; but at length they begin to grow tired of it—they
jump down from their pedestals, seize Meijer, and hold
him fast, saying</em>, “You rascal! this is too much of a good
thing!” <em>They strike him, and push him out at the door—losing
their wigs in the struggle—after which they burst out
laughing, and drop exhausted into their chairs. Enter F.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Gentlemen! what have you been up to now?
Such an infernal row I never heard before! You’ll wake
all the babies in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><em>John.</em> The worshipper of waxwork groups!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Well—where is he? What have you done
with him?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> We have put him out at the door as quietly
and deliberately as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Well—and why?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Because he bored us too much. He was so delighted
with the mechanism of the figures, that we might
have kept on dancing till to-morrow morning if we had not
put an end to the business ourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> And what about your coiffures?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> Why, that’s true! What can have become of
them!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Oh! good heavens! here they are, lying on
the ground like any old rubbish! [<em>Picks them up, along with
the hat and cap.</em>] Just look!—they are not worth a cent
now!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Oh! just put the things away—we don’t want them
any more,—and if they’re spoilt, we’ll pay for them.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> In that case, sir, it doesn’t matter. [<em>Lays
everything on a table. The bell rings.</em>] Hé! who’s that now?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> It doesn’t matter to me who it is. Any one may
come who likes—I’m not going to act in this farce any longer.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon</em> (<em>looks through the door</em>). Look out, gentlemen—it’s
the agent—Bom de Sac!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John and Charles</em> (<em>springing up</em>). That fellow! No! that
will never do! [<em>They sit down at the table, as before, and put

was not for nothing I was wounded eleven times in ten

of that! [<em>Enters.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span><em>Fournichon.</em> Search as much as you like, sir, but remember,
if you please, that, in the presence of ladies....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Of course, of course! I always said, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honneur
aux dames</span></i>.” [<em>Looks at the ladies and salutes, then takes
a step backward in amazement.</em>] <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacré nom de guerre!</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> What’s the matter?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Have I come to my age—not to speak of
twelve wounds in eleven battles—to let myself be fooled like
this?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> I don’t understand you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> No, perhaps not. But I understand how it is
possible for these ladies to have changed heads at a
moment’s notice. Look here! [<em>He takes off the wigs.</em>]
The young lady is getting grey, and the grandmother is
going backwards to her childhood. Come with me, now,
gentlemen—I arrest you both!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> Your own fault, gentlemen. I wash my hands
of the whole business.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> We have a word to say to that, John.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Certainly.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Gentlemen, conspiracies or plots in which
more than one person are concerned are forbidden by law.
Will you come with me, or not?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em> I suppose we shall have to.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> Do you want us to come with you as we are?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Just as you like, gentlemen. I arrest you,
and that is all my share in the business. The rest does not
concern me.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles</em> (<em>whispers to John, then continues aloud</em>). Just listen,
Monsieur Bom de Sac,—though we find it very unpleasant
to have fallen into your hands, we are not children, and we
are quite capable of understanding that there is nothing for
it but to give in. But just let us change our clothes first—we’ll
give you our word of honour not to go out of the door
without letting you know.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Very good! We have been young, too, you
see. Just go on, gentlemen. If you give me your word, that
is enough. [<em>While he goes on talking to Fournichon, John
and Charles take off their costumes and tie Bom de Sac’s coattails
to the table.</em>] Yes, Mr Hairdresser, when I was with
the 11th, and had been wounded thirteen times in twelve
battles, then I thought to myself,—it’s quite enough, Bom
de Sac, you have done quite enough for your country;
you’re growing old—and a soldier may be too old. I was
then brigadier, and understood that it was getting time for
me to make room for another. So I came home to my old
mother&nbsp;... I married a young wife....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Charles.</em>&nbsp;... and received, in thirteen battles....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Ah!—are you ready, gentlemen?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>John.</em> At your service, my worthy sergeant of police! We
are quite ready, and now warn you that we are about to
leave. [<em>Charles and John go out by the door at the back of
the stage, arm in arm, saying, as they go.</em>]—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon soir.</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> Wait—I’m coming with you! <em>[Tries to go,
but finds himself fastened to the table.</em>] Bad luck to them!
are they going to give me the slip after all?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fournichon.</em> I see a good chance of it. Look here,
Monsieur Bom de Sac, you have, in far too many battles
received more than too many wounds to be anything like a
match for these young fellows. They have been sharper
than you,—so you’ll have to acknowledge yourself beaten,
and e’en let them alone. By the time you get outside the
door they will be far beyond your reach.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Bom de Sac.</em> You’re right enough there, so I shall keep the
whole matter to myself, and wish them a pleasant evening.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>IN THE LITTLE REPUBLIC.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was in the smallest Republic of our Continent—Altenet—rich
in mines of zinc. It lies, like a tiny wedge,
between the great German empire, the small kingdom of
Holland, and the still smaller one of Belgium.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seldom has a stranger set foot here; few know the district
even by name; only a single encyclopædia makes mention
of it; the atlases have forgotten it,—nay, it has even been
forgotten by the political world.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the separation between Belgium and Holland took
place in 1830, the representatives of the various powers
could not come to any agreement over this little piece of
ground. It was therefore resolved to declare it “neutral
territory,” till a later Congress should find a better solution
to the problem.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old schoolmaster of the neighbouring village of
Oppenaken always asserted that the learned politicians
assembled at the aforesaid Congress had been too drunk to
know what they were doing. If his listeners looked at
him incredulously, or began to laugh, he would indignantly
ask, “Don’t you believe me? Then I’ll prove it!” And
then he would fetch an atlas, open it at the map of the
Netherlands, and, following with his finger the boundary of
our provinces of Limburg and Brabant, continue—“Just
look at this line here how it goes—first to the left, then to
the right—here crooked, then slanting—then again forward
for a bit, then backwards—one minute straight, and then
again with a great bend—isn’t it just like the line a tipsy
man would take in walking?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the year 1866 another European Congress took place;
but it seemed as though the gentlemen taking part in it had
not recovered from the effects of the drinking bout attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>to them by the Oppenaken schoolmaster, for this time
Altenet was forgotten—forgotten for good and all.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_140.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“TOO DRUNK TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus the Altenetters lived on, independent of all foreign
domination. The miners continued to extract zinc from the
ground, and pile it up in the great waggons which transported
it to other countries; the peasant ploughed his field and
reaped his grain; the wind might be heard sighing in the
clumps of trees on the hill-tops, the brook rushing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>murmuring between the rocks, and the lark singing high in
air—and what could you want more?</p>

<p class='c009'>The government of the little Republic was entirely in the
hands of the burgomaster, Willem Drikus Bloemstein, a
broad-shouldered man of portly presence, red-haired and
red-bearded, fully conscious of his own importance, and
loyally supported in all his works and ways by the elect of
Altenet, who were associated with him as Councillors.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite an earthly Paradise—a little Eden full of
peace and happiness! Here was no such thing as strife
or hatred, for parties had no existence, and life offered
no opportunity for insult or injury on political grounds.
The taxes were not high, and there was no standing army,
so that no one thought it necessary to hold meetings in
order to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of compulsory
service. The only measure taken for the defence
of the country was the weekly drill of the rural rifle corps;
and though no one was forced to take his place in its ranks,
yet every right-minded man of Altenet felt it his duty to
place himself under the orders of General Bauer—on working
days an energetic mine-superintendent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly this happy state of things was disturbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tiresome man—a German politician—had discovered
the above-mentioned negligence on the part of the statesmen
of Europe, and pointed out to the Government of his country
that here was an opportunity for gratifying its well-known
love of annexation. The high and mighty Reichstag took
the hint, and resolved to proceed to a speedy settlement of
the still unsolved question of the division of Altenet.</p>

<p class='c009'>A storm of indignation swept through the whole Republic.
The head of the State, honest Bloemstein, immediately
summoned all the members of the Council, in order to consult
as to ways and means of averting the threatened misfortune,
and the summons was obeyed by every one.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were all assembled. Klessens, the rich brewer;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>young Holzert, an ugly little man, whose bow-legs were a
continual challenge to any poodle who had learned to jump
through a hoop, but whose shrewdness and clear insight into
things were praised by every one; the just-mentioned Bauer,
the commander of the rifle corps; Marbaise, the landlord of
the “Lump of Zinc”; and Conrads, the wealthy farmer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s got to be done?” was the question addressed by
Bloemstein to the notables of Altenet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to me we ought to write the Prussian a civil
letter, telling him not to trouble his head about us,” was the
opinion delivered by Klessens, after coughing and clearing
his throat for some time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You stupid fellow!” replied Bauer, pulling in an impressive
manner at his thick moustache, “do you think the
insolent dog of a Prussian will care anything for a civil
letter? No, my boy, you don’t know him yet; <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au contraire</span></i>,
we ought to show him we’re not afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, then! there <em>will</em> be war!” was timidly interjected
by Conrads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well then! there will be war!” The rest nodded
assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that will surely be a great-to-do,—couldn’t we wait
at least till the crops are in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We won’t wait a moment! I shall march with the
Rifles to-morrow, right along the Prussian border, and then
the miserable wretches can see that we’re not afraid of them!”
and Bauer banged the table with his fists.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s not nearly enough,” suggested Marbaise; “the
custom-house officers might forget to write to the Emperor
about it, and as long as he doesn’t know it, it all goes for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ought to write to him ourselves, and not civilly,—no,
indeed!—but as impudently as we can; and you must sign
the letter, Bloemstein, just as if you were a king yourself,
and put under it ‘Wullem the First, President of the
Republic of Altenet.’”</p>

<p>“BAUER BANGED THE TABLE WITH HIS FISTS.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Wullem, Wullem! why, there are so many Wullems,”
was the opinion of the man addressed; “the Dutch one is
called so, and the Prussian too. ‘Wullem!’—it’s so
common.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you have another name, haven’t you?” asked another
Councillor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course,—Drikus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then,—Drikus the First. What do you think
of that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well,” muttered Klessens. “‘Drikus the First,
President of the Republic of Altenet’; it doesn’t sound bad,
not bad at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t it be still better to say, ‘President of the
<em>Independent</em> Republic’?” added the warlike Bauer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We might do that,” was the general verdict.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But then we ought to be called Ministers,” suggested
Conrads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!” chorussed the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case, I suppose I shall be Minister of War?”
asked Bauer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I of Agriculture?” asked Conrads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marbaise for Finance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And whom shall we have for Home Affairs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to me that wouldn’t be a bad thing for you,
tailor,” put in Bloemstein, addressing Councillor Holzert.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no objection,” replied the latter; “but I’d just
like to say something too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Councillor Holzert will now address the meeting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A sudden silence fell on the assembly; all were straining
their ears to hear what thoughts had arisen in the tailor’s
shrewd brain. Speaking slowly, and emphasising every
word, he began,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must have stamps made—big stamps, with your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>head on them, Bloemstein; and then we’ll send a letter,
with a stamp like that on it, you understand, not to the
Emperor of Prussia, but to Bismarck, because, after all, he’s
the fellow that does everything; and you must write in that
letter, just to rile him, that we are going to let all the priests
and Jesuits he has driven out come freely into our country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But only on condition that they brew no beer,” interrupted
the brewer, Klessens.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tailor made believe not to have heard this interested
remark, and ended his speech with the question, “What do
you think of <em>that</em> idea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bravo, bravo!” cried all; and “You’re a sharp lad;
you’re a clever fellow,” added the chairman of the meeting,
as he passed his hand complacently over the head whose
portrait was shortly to be sent to the Chancellor of the
German Empire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We haven’t done yet,” continued Holzert; “we have
still to find out how we’re going to put your head on the
stamps,—with a beard, with a moustache only, or without
anything at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you do think of everything, tailor!” observed
Marbaise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bauer declared that there could be no two opinions on
the point—“With a moustache, that’s quite military,” and,
as he spoke, he twisted the ends of his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t think it would look very well—a red moustache,”
objected Marbaise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what does that matter? You can’t see it in the
picture,” returned Conrads. “Bismarck has a white one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t quite know whether you’re right,” began Holzert
again; “just look at Napoleon,—I mean the great Napoleon,—he’s
got nothing, no beard and no moustache, and yet he
sent the Prussians to the right-about, time and again; but
what do you think about it yourself, Bloemstein?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what am I to say to you? A beard is not respectable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>and I shall have mine shaved off; then we can see if
the moustache alone looks well; and if that is not the case,
I’ll have that taken off too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All thought this an excellent idea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t get shaved here, though. You’d better have that
done at Aix-la-Chapelle, and then you can get yourself taken
at the same time for the stamps.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Among the Prussians? Never! as long as I live. I’ll
never help them to earn a cent,” thundered Bloemstein.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Maastricht, then,” suggested another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. I’ll have it done on Monday. Has any one
anything more to say to the meeting?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked at each other, but no one broke the silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one’s got nothing, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just wait a minute,” cried Conrads. “You ought to
have a crown, Bloemstein.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A crown?—that’s expensive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense; have one made of brass, and well polished
up, then it will shine just as if it were gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we ought to have Ministers’ uniforms. I’ll make
them as cheap and as quickly as possible,” said the tailor-Minister;
“and then I’ll make a long cloak for you,
Bloemstein.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the gentlemen will allow, I’ve something more to
say,” said Marbaise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Marbaise’s turn to speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ought to forbid all Altenet girls marrying Prussians.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about my Marieke, who’s courting with the
Prussian doctor?” was Bloemstein’s terrified reply. “What
a set-out my daughter will make—and, above all, my wife,
when I tell them that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you must just say that our country doesn’t permit
it,” and the whole assembly nodded in token of assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lord!” groaned the unlucky President; “it’s the
hardest thing you could ask me to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“Our country! the Republic! the Independent Republic!”
cried the others, wagging their heads hither and thither,
shrugging up their shoulders, and holding out their hands
with all their fingers extended in air.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_147.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“BOTH WALKED ON IN SILENCE.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Here the weighty deliberations came to an end; and
thereupon the President and his Ministers slowly proceeded
homewards.</p>

<p class='c009'>Holzert escorted the newly appointed ruler to his dwelling.
For a considerable time both walked on in silence. At last
the tailor spoke:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Bloemstein,” he began, “if your Marieke is not to marry
the Prussian doctor,&nbsp;... in that case&nbsp;... I’d like to have
her. I always had a liking for the girl; but I couldn’t say
anything;&nbsp;... but now I’m Minister of the Interior,&nbsp;...
that sounds fine, eh?&nbsp;... that’s something.... I think
perhaps it might do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, my good fellow, I’ve nothing against you. You
always were a clever chap, and you’ve shown it again with
those stamps. It would be a good enough idea;&nbsp;... but—Marieke!
and then my wife!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, after all, you’re the master. Why, you’re the king
of everything in the place! You must put on a bold face,
and stand firm!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, lad, I’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With wrathful strides, his head well thrown back, and his
hand resting on the front of his ample waistcoat, Bloemstein
entered his own house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marieke sprang to meet him, embraced him cordially,
and then said, “Father, I’ve just had a letter from Heinrich,
he’s coming to dinner with us to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very sorry, child; but this marriage with the Prussian
doctor can’t come to anything. I’ve another husband for
you. You’re to marry my Minister of the Interior.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whom do you say I am to marry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My Minister of the Interior.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Holzert.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The crooked tailor! what a joke! I didn’t know you
could be so funny, father!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s no joke; it’s quite serious, Marieke!” and he recounted
all that had taken place at the meeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marieke, however, was not convinced. “I won’t have
him!” she cried, and stamped her little foot on the ground;—“and
if you say I must, I’ll never marry at all!—there!
 ... I’ll go and tell mother about it!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Bloemstein did not await the arrival of his better half.
Under pretext of urgent business, the ruler of all Altenet,
except his own house, hastily escaped up the street, and did
not return home till late in the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the following day—it was Sunday—all Altenet was
clean turned upside down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bauer had summoned all his riflemen, as soon as high
mass was over, and they assembled in full uniform at the
tavern kept by the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a vigorous and pithy speech,—which he had been
thinking over all night,—he explained to his troops the
danger which threatened the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>His manly language carried his audience with him. The
shout, “We’ll conquer or die!” raised by the Minister of
War, was loudly echoed by every one; and in order still
further to raise their courage, they all added, “Another
drop all round!” which was poured out by the Minister of
Finance in his shirt-sleeves, and with fingers trembling with
emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now,” yelled Bauer, “we’re going to make a military
march along the Prussian frontier, and then all that
<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">canaille</span></i> can see that we’re not afraid of them. Marbaise—you
with the drum, your eldest boy with the accordeon, and
the other with the trumpet in front,—you three are the band.
Then you, Ummels, with the flag; and you, Gradus, with
the bird; and then we, the people!”</p>

<p class='c009'>However, it was a considerable time before all of them
had left the tavern and taken up their positions.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were a peculiar-looking troop, of about a hundred
and twenty men; mostly broad-shouldered fellows, though
not tall—a kind of build common to most miners. They
wore all possible costumes, of all sorts of colours; check
trousers and black coats—blue blouses, long, short, new, or
half-worn;—suits of cloth, wool or linen—here and there a
hero marching in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots</span></i>. The majority were armed with
old-fashioned bell-mouthed blunderbusses; some, the tallest
of the lot, were provided with double-barrelled fowling-pieces,
which at once branded them as poachers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
<img src='images/i_150.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“CAUSED THEM TO GO THROUGH ALL POSSIBLE MANŒUVRES.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>All, however, had the same head-covering—a green cap,
with yellow braid,—and all had wooden pipes in their mouths.
The flag matched the caps—white and yellowish green.
The place next to the flag was occupied by the silver bird,
hung round with all the gold and silver medals worn by the
Altenetters in shooting competitions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out!” cried Bauer, who, in token of his exalted
position was hung round with a string of small silver plates
of different shapes and sizes, and who, besides, showed his
superior dignity by smoking, not a pipe like the rest, but a
cigar of immense length and thickness, which had cost him
two cents and a half.</p>

<p class='c009'>All placed themselves in position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right-about-face, and along the cinder path to the
Prussian frontier. Band, advance!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They advanced, with drum beating and accordeon chirping.
Just in full view of the German officials, who had come out
to ascertain the cause of the approaching noise, Bauer called
a halt. Then he caused them to go through all possible
manœuvres, shoulder arms, port arms,—but not “present”—<em>that</em>
he would never do “for those pig-dogs of Prussians.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These evolutions did not appear to command any particular
admiration on the part of the Germans; pitying
smiles were seen to pass over their countenances, and when
at the command “Right-about-face!” half the company
turned to the left, so that the soldiers of Altenet stood facing
each other, they burst into a roar of laughter, which so
aroused the wrath of Klaos Drehmans (who had spent some
years at Sittard), that he stepped out of the ranks, and
snorted defiance at the principal custom-house clerk as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“You! do you know what <em>you</em> are? you’re a regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>nuisance!” while another member of the Altenet militia
yelled at the top of his voice, quite at a loss for a worse
epithet, “Oh! thou accursed Prussian of a Prussian!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was truly a triumphal march when the Republican
army returned from this glorious campaign; the inhabitants
uttered loud cries of joy, alternating with abuse of the
cowardly Prussian lot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bloemstein stood, proudly defiant, in the full consciousness
of his presidential dignity, on the “stoop” of his house.
And when the standard-bearer had waved his flag three
times over his head in the President’s honour, and then
tossed it on high, the President smiled very genially, and
waved back a salute with his hand, blowing thick clouds of
smoke the while from his long German pipe, a proceeding
which elicited thundering “hurrahs” from assembled
Altenet.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only Altenetters who had not been able to witness
this sublime spectacle were Bloemstein’s wife and daughter;
they had walked out to meet Dr Olthausen coming from Aix-la-Chapelle,
and fell in with him near the village of Vaals.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the usual salutations, Marieke related to her betrothed
all the changes which had taken place in the government
of Altenet, and also her father’s resolution to marry
her to the Minister of the Interior. At this part of the story
the mother clenched her fists, her eyes flashed fire, and she
said, threateningly, “Just let the fellow come into our house,
and I’ll make him repent his Affairs of the Interior.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To the great surprise of both ladies, Olthausen did not
appear to be angry; on the contrary, he began to laugh
loudly, and seemed especially diverted by the story of the
postage-stamps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have a regular good joke out of that,” he said, still
laughing; “but I won’t come to dinner with you to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you afraid of Bloemstein?” asked the mother.
“Because you needn’t be; I shall be at dinner too.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“No, I’m not afraid of him—only of laughing more than
I ought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind that; laugh at him as he deserves, and
we’ll laugh too, won’t we, Marieke?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nein, liebes Madamchen</span></i>,” returned the doctor, “it will
be better if I don’t come—we’ll have some dinner here.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“JUST LET THE FELLOW COME INTO OUR HOUSE.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He went with the two women into the nearest eating-house
in the village and ordered dinner, also two sheets of
paper and an envelope. While the ladies were dining, he
wrote a letter on one sheet, slowly and carefully, with beautiful
round letters, then dashed off another more hastily, and
enclosed both in one envelope, which he stamped and
addressed to “Herrn Oscar Olthausen, Rechtsanwalt,
Berlin.” He then directed Marieke to wait till her father
was about to send away the letters with the new Altenet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>stamps. “Then you must keep back the one addressed to
Bismarck, and post this in place of it; and then I assure
you that everything will come right, without you or your
mother getting into any trouble with the old gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They remained chatting for some little time longer, and
then Dr Olthausen took his leave and returned to Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early on the following day Drikus the First set out for
Limburg’s metropolis. Arrived there, he turned his steps
towards the barber’s shop. A young shopman came to meet
him, and politely relieved him of his coat and hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, lad,” began Bloemstein, “did you ever shave
a president?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes, sir; only yesterday the President of the Congregation
of the Sacred Heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I don’t mean one like that; I mean a great
president.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the one of the great club?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—greater still.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The President of the Tribunal, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; greater still—a president of a republic!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of a republic, you say? No, I never shaved one—never
in my life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know what he looks like?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes—like a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, my boy; I see you understand. Now,
that’s the way you’ve got to shave me—for I’m one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You a president of a republic? Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you laughing at, boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because you’re trying to make a fool of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed and I’m not. I’m Drikus the First, President
of the Independent Republic of Altenet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lad laughed no longer; he looked round in alarm,
convinced that he had a madman in the room with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shave my beard off!” commanded Bloemstein.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Very well, Mr&nbsp;... President.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À la bonne heure</span></i>, my lad! I like that—you know how
to behave.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_155.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“SEE HERE, LAD, DID YOU EVER SHAVE A PRESIDENT?”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As speedily as possible the wish of this strange customer
was gratified.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Now just wait a bit, my boy. I must see how the
moustache looks by itself,” and the ruler of the republic
placed himself before the mirror.</p>

<p class='c009'>He remained for some time lost in admiration, then began
to turn the points of his moustache first up and then down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think of it, lad? Is it good enough for a
president of a republic?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold your tongue, then, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, Mr&nbsp;... President&nbsp;... as you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly honest Bloemstein turned round and fairly
snorted at the poor youth. “Just shave this side off,” he
blustered, pointing to the right half of his countenance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The youthful Figaro hastened to comply, having heard
that a madman must not be contradicted or he may become
violent. His request having been complied with, the President
rose in order to admire himself in the mirror. He
covered first one and then the other half of his face with
one hand, in order to convince himself which style was
most becoming to the presidential dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The attractions of the clean-shaven half at length prevailed,
and the last remaining hair was removed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What have you got to get?” asked Bloemstein, when
this was done.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten centimes&nbsp;... Mr President.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are two groschen for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have to give you two centimes change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind that—you may keep them. A president of
a republic has nothing mean about him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And with a proud and stately demeanour he departed in
the direction of the photographer’s. Scarcely had he left
the barber’s, when the boy hastened to the police-office, to
relate how he had just been shaving a fellow who must
certainly have just escaped from the lunatic asylum, for he
had told him quite seriously that he was the president of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>republic. A policeman started immediately with the
terrified barber’s boy to search the streets of Maastricht for
the lunatic.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was, however, in vain. Bloemstein had already entered
the studio of a neighbouring photographer, muttering, “I
shall have to explain myself differently here. It seems as
though these Maastricht people had never heard of the
president of a republic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the photographer appeared, he accordingly delivered
himself as follows: “I want my photograph taken, but it
must be properly done, for I am a king.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, sir. Shall I give you a gun, then, or do you
prefer a bow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A gun!—a bow! What for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I’ve photographed a whole number of kings, and
they——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! you know how to do it then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What kings have you taken?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, only yesterday the Gronsveld one, and a few days
ago one from Neer-Itteren.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How—what—kings of Gronsveld and Neer-Itteren?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course—those of the archery competition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You confounded idiot!—did I get shaved for that?
Do I look like a king of the archery competition? Why, I
am king of a country—of a republic—an independent
republic! Do you understand now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh heavens!” cried the artist to himself, “the fellow is
certainly touched in the upper storey, and I shall have to
look out, or he’ll knock the whole shop to pieces.” He
made his visitor a low bow, and said,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very pleased, sir, to be honoured with your custom.
May I ask your Majesty to take a seat.... How would you
like your portrait, full-length, or bust only?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing but the bust; it’s for the stamps of the country,
do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Certainly, certainly, sir, and will you kindly look through
this thing?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_158.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“NOW YOU CAN GO AHEAD.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, but remember that I want it to look respectable—do
you hear?&nbsp;... And just wait a bit—I must see
if my hair is all right;” and he hastened to the looking-glass,
moistened his palms, smoothed his head with them, and
took his place, with a last self-satisfied look at his own image.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you can go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The photographer placed himself in front of his apparatus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and declared, a moment later, that the picture was a splendid
success, notwithstanding the fact that it was impossible to
pronounce on that point with any degree of certainty, since
he had not the courage to go into the dark room and leave
his eccentric customer alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When will they be finished?” asked Bloemstein.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! as soon as your Majesty likes to have them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I have them next week? All right then, just send
them to Drikus the First, King of the Independent Republic
of Altenet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do so without fail, your Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they turn out well, I’ll come back and bring my wife
the queen, and my daughter the princess; and I’ll give you
leave to hang out a fine gilt signboard with your own name
on it, and after that ‘Photographer to the King of the
Republic of Altenet.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do my best, your Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The photographer too, immediately after his visitor’s
departure, hastened away to the temple of Justice, with the
tidings that a fellow as mad as a hatter, calling himself
king of a republic, had just been at his studio. Another
gendarme was at once sent in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the object of their solicitude had entered the
church of St Servaas. It had struck him that, since his
august head ought certainly to be adorned with a crown, he
might here find a pattern for the same in painting or sculpture.
He remained standing a long time before a picture
representing the Adoration of the Magi, but none of the
three crowns worn by those royal personages suited his fancy.
“They haven’t got points enough,” he muttered, and searched
further, but in vain, till at last he came to a statue of the
Madonna, which realised his ideal. There was the crown he
had always imagined—with points standing straight up all
round it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He delayed not a moment, but hastened out into the
street, and entered the first coppersmith’s shop he came to.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“Can you make me a crown like Our Lady’s in St
Servaas’s?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! yes, sir. What size do you want it?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_160.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“HIS AUGUST HEAD OUGHT CERTAINLY TO BE ADORNED WITH A CROWN.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“As big as my head; you can take the measure now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for? You don’t want to wear it, do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“Of course I do—nothing is more certain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, are you mad? or might you happen to be a Freemason?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mad! mad! Mad yourself, fellow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just wait a bit, and I’ll show you which of us is mad!” and
before the poor president could assume a defensive attitude,
the smith had seized him and thrown him into the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>This roused Bloemstein’s wrath, and his objurgations
speedily collected a crowd in the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There he is!” a voice cried suddenly, echoed by “Now
you’ve got him!” from another quarter, as the barber’s boy
and the photographer appeared on the scene, escorted by
a policeman apiece. In the twinkling of an eye the two
officials had mastered the furious president, and in spite
of his vigorous resistance, and his protestation that, as
President of Altenet, his person was inviolable, the unhappy
man was lugged off to the little dark hole known to the
population of Maastricht as “the larder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is your name?” was the first question asked him
by the police commissioner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might ask it a little more civilly,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>The commissioner immediately complied with this request.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you be so kind as to tell me whom I have the
honour of speaking to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the proper way to speak, and now I shall answer
you. I am Wullem Drikus Bloemstein, President of the
Independent Republic of Altenet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where do you live?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I should have thought you had no need to ask.
At Altenet, the capital of the Republic of Altenet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the inspectors was immediately despatched to
Altenet to make inquiries on the spot as to the personality
of the prisoner.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
<img src='images/i_162.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“THERE HE IS!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>The officer returned the same day, with the tidings that
all Altenet was one great lunatic asylum; that every human
being he had met and spoken to there was even madder
than the one who had been caught; everything he had seen
and heard was sheer nonsense and delirium, and so he had
been obliged to return as he came.</p>

<p class='c009'>Medical aid was summoned, but all in vain; the gentlemen
were unable to agree, one asserting that the patient
was suffering from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aberratio mentalis</span></i>, while another thought
things were not so bad as that.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, what business is it of ours?” said one at last.
“Send him back to his home, and let them settle it among
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This counsel met with unanimous approbation, and was,
in fact, the most practical, and at the same time the easiest,
way of disposing of the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bloemstein was furious; and when the gendarmes who
escorted him took leave of him at the frontier, he was
almost beside himself with rage. He would have liked to
take them with him into his dominions, where he was undisputed
lord and master; he would then have summoned the
commander of the local rifles, and ordered him to shut up the
Maastricht officials for a whole day in the cellar below the
council-chamber. But, alas! fate was against him, he
could not gratify his desire for vengeance; but being forced
to relieve his feelings in some way, he did so by indignantly
shouting after their retreating figures, “You Dutch cheese-heads,
you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With hasty steps he forthwith sought his chief counsellor,
the Minister for Home Affairs, the tailor Holzert. In
excited language, and with wild gestures, he related the story
of the outrage suffered by him at Maastricht, and asked, in
conclusion, “What are we to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tailor put his hand to his head, and remained for
some little time lost in thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are we to do?” repeated Bloemstein; “we can’t
let a thing like that pass.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“What are we to do?” replied Holzert, speaking slowly and
solemnly. “Why, we must declare war against Holland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Declare war against Holland?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For high treason.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, you’re right; we must send for Bauer at
once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not so fast; we must have the stamps first, with
your head on them, and then the Hollanders can see
whom they have to deal with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right again, tailor,” said Drikus I., flattered not
a little by these words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Besides that, I haven’t finished the ministers’ suits yet,
and we can do nothing without them; everything has got
to be respectable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>During the next few days an unheard-of political commotion
prevailed in the usually calm atmosphere of
Altenet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every evening, when work was over, Bauer’s rifles assembled
in the Minister of Finance’s public-house, in order to
exchange ideas as to the coming war with Holland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Guesses were given as to where the first battle would be
fought, and calculations were made as to how soon they
would be before the gates of Amsterdam, and how many
thousand millions they would make the Dutch pay as war
indemnity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bloemstein, meanwhile, wrote innumerable letters to all
the powers of Europe, to give them notice of his accession.
All of them were enclosed in large square envelopes,
and laid out in a long row on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when once I’ve stuck on the stamps, with my head
on them, why, then, I shall be no end of a fellow, Marieke,”
he repeatedly remarked to his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>The portraits, however, did not arrive.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_165.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“WROTE INNUMERABLE LETTERS TO ALL THE POWERS OF EUROPE.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After the lapse of a fortnight, Bloemstein’s ploughman—for
he had no intention of going to Maastricht again himself—was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>sent to the photographer’s, to ask whether the
portraits of the President of the Republic of Altenet were
not yet ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you really want them?—seriously?” inquired the artist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose so, seeing as how I had to come here a-purpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I’ll send them next week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the appointed time the impatiently awaited packet at
last arrived at the house of Altenet’s ruler. Something else
arrived as well,—the long royal mantle promised by the
tailor, richly ornamented with gold fringe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bloemstein was quite excited with joy. Without a
moment’s delay he flung the royal insignia round his
shoulders, and then stood before the mirror, admiring
his front and back view by turns. He was satisfied—perfectly
and entirely satisfied—both with the garment and
him who wore it!</p>

<p class='c009'>“The other fellows must see that too! Thunder! how
they’ll stare!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately Bloemstein’s man was sent to summon
the council, and before long Marbaise, Klessens, Conrads,
Bauer, and Holzert entered—all clad in their uniforms, consisting
of long coats trimmed with gold lace, knee-breeches,
long woollen stockings of a doubtful white, and swords
dangling at their sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite evident that Holzert had given his whole time
and attention to the job, as was, moreover, irrefutably proved
by an unexpected incident.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all were gathered round the big table, loudly
uttering their admiration of their ruler’s portrait, long
Kwoib Hermes suddenly rushed into the room, in his red
baize drawers, with the tails of a blue shirt fluttering above
them, and shouted aloud—“Thou accursed tailor, where
are my trousers? I must go to early mass to-morrow, and I
have no trousers!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“You shall have them to-morrow; to-morrow morning
early, Kwoib,” replied the indignant tradesman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I want them to-night. You’ve promised me them
all the week, and I’m going to have those trousers of mine
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Man, don’t make such a scandalous row! Just think
where you are—before the ministers of the republican
council!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ministers and the council and the whole republic
may be stolen, for all I care! I want my trousers, and I’m
not going away from here before I get them.” And therewith
he took a chair, and seated himself among the ministers
of the crown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you get out or not?” asked Bauer, threateningly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I’m not going before I get my trousers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly Bloemstein heard the steps of his wife and
daughter, who were coming to see what the noise was.
Fearing that they might come in for this unseemly spectacle,
he thrust the intruder into the next room, with the words,
“There; you’ll find some trousers in there; just put them
on in the meantime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not long after, Hermes appeared in a garment much too
short for him, which, however, by way of compensation, was
also a great deal too wide.</p>

<p class='c009'>The assembly was now able to finish its deliberations in
peace and quiet. The portraits having been unanimously
approved of, No. 2 of the Agenda came up for discussion.
This was, “Declaration of war against Holland on the ground
of high treason.” The debate was lively and confused.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bauer wanted to summon his men at once, surprise
Maastricht the same night, take the garrison prisoners, and
march farther into the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Conrads, on the other hand, could see no good in such
incautious haste. “Let’s wait till we get the corn in; then
we can bake bread for our men through the war.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“No need of that!” shouted Bauer. “We’ll get all the
bread we want from the Dutch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Holzert was inclined to agree with Conrads, but for other
reasons. “We must ask for explanations first; that’s always
the way,” he declared. “We ought to give them time to
investigate the outrage committed on our president, and
make their apologies. Besides that,” he added, “till we
have stamps of our own we can’t declare war.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s true, that’s true!” cried several voices, “it would
never do to declare war on Holland with Prussian stamps.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then,” raged Bauer, “but you must get them
made directly, Bloemstein!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll promise that,” replied the President.</p>

<p class='c009'>Herewith the solemn session concluded.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i_168.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>A few weeks later the longed-for
stamps appeared. They looked
neat enough. A striking likeness
of Bloemstein was surrounded by
a garland of intertwined spades
and pickaxes—symbols of labour—and
above, in good bold letters,
ALTENET.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were blue, red, and green
ones—of one, two, and three groschen respectively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marieke! Marieke!” cried the delighted Bloemstein.
“Come here, child; I’ve something to show you. What do
you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, quite beautiful, father!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And will they be sent to all the kings and emperors—all
in the whole world?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All in the whole world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Bismarck too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s going to get one as well; but it won’t please him,
I assure you, Marieke.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Now you’ll need to send them off at once; may I help
you to put the stamps on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely, Marieke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The father and daughter sat down before the table, on
which lay the long row of already written letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s Bismarck’s!” cried the girl suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put double stamps on that,” said Bloemstein.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of obeying this order, Marieke contrived to slip
the letter into her pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall I take them to the post-office now, father?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, do, child—only mind you don’t lose any, specially
the one to Bismarck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t be afraid,” and she skipped out of the room
to fetch her hat, and perhaps also the letter she had received
from her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancé</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not long before an answer came from Berlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bloemstein summoned his faithful councillors at once, in
order to open the official document in their midst. The
ministers hastened to the council-chamber, as fast as their
legs could carry them. They took up positions behind their
President, and stuck their heads together, trying to see with
their own eyes the answer from the German Empire.</p>

<p class='c009'>With trembling hand Bloemstein opened the missive, and
in a voice quivering with emotion, he began to read, in
German:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>“<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verehrter Herr Präsident.</span></i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“In reply to your letter, I have received orders from my
Emperor to declare war on your Republic, and send off an
army of 150,000 men to the frontier, because—</p>

<p class='c022'>“1. You have caused postage-stamps to be made without
permission from the German Government.</p>

<p class='c022'>“2. It is known to us that you have been taking upon yourself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>to oppose your daughter’s marriage to our loyal subject,
Dr Heinrich Olthausen.</p>

<p class='c022'>“3. You want to force that charming and lovely girl to
marry an objectionable, crooked tailor.</p>

<p class='c022'>“We give you a week to comply with our conditions.</p>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Bismarck.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment’s painful silence. There it was, in
great fat round letters—“<span class='sc'>Bismarck</span>.” There was no possible
doubt about it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“DECLARE WAR!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The confounded low <em>Schwerenöther</em> of a Prussian!”
yelled Holzert at last, crimson with passion, and quivering
on his little bow-legs. “Declare war, Bloemstein! declare
war!” he went on. “Let them come, the low <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">canaille!</span></i>
we’ll blow up the mine as soon as they get on top of it, and
then there’ll be an end of them!” and suddenly turning
to the Minister of War, he added, “Bauer, how many men
have you?”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“A hundred and twenty-three, counting the band,” was
the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s not one to a thousand,” suggested Conrads;
“and besides that, we’ve got the war with Holland on our
hands,—it won’t do—it won’t do! What do you think
yourself, Bauer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What I think? I think you’re a coward, Conrads, to
talk so—a coward, do you understand? Conquer or die,
that’s our cry!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but we can’t conquer, and dying isn’t much good.
Holzert won’t get his Marieke by it if we do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But in that case the Prussian pig-dog won’t have her
either!” shouted Holzert, banging the table with his fists.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this, however, Bloemstein’s paternal feelings revolted.
His daughter, his pretty Marieke—dead! No, he would
rather see her married to the Prussian doctor, for the
Prussians were not so bad after all! Nay, they even knew
how to appreciate beauty—had not Bismarck himself written
that she was a “charming, lovely girl”?</p>

<p class='c009'>Klessens also was for peace, and so was Marbaise.
“Against 150,000 Prussians,” said the latter, “and a few
thousand Hollanders on top of those, you, Bauer, with your
hundred and twenty men——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A hundred and twenty-three!” interrupted the commander
of the Altenet forces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, a hundred and twenty-three, if you like—but you
can’t do anything with them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A great deal more talking and shouting took place, and at
last the President determined to end the debate by putting
the question to the vote.</p>

<p class='c009'>“War!” yelled Holzert. “Peace!” “Peace!” “Peace!”
muttered Conrads, Marbaise, and Klessens, in succession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“War!” thundered Bauer; and “I’m for peace,” said the
President in conclusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peace was therefore resolved on by a majority of two votes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Several months have passed. The miners are at work
again; the farmer is ploughing his fields; the lark sings high
in air; the Altenet postage-stamps have been destroyed;
and Marieke is the happy wife of Dr Olthausen.</p>

<p class='c009'>No answer was ever received from the rest of the kings
and emperors,—it is just possible that Marieke may have
forgotten to post the letters entrusted to her care.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>FICTION AT SEA.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is quiet now on deck. The singing forward has ceased,
the watch is set, and the larboard watch, who are to come
on at midnight, are below—including the tall corporal of
marines, whom we heard just now singing bass. But the
little monkey of a boy, who took the tenor part in “O Julia!”
belongs to the starboard watch, and now has another occupation
on hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seated on a tub turned upside down, close to the foremast,
he is reading aloud, by the light of a lantern, out of
an “awfully fine” book.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy (his name is Jozef) can read “real first-rate”;
and from each of the listeners seated round him he is to
receive the sum of two cents.</p>

<p class='c009'>The book which he now has before him, and which is
covered with oil-stains, because he has to hold it so
close to the lantern,—the book which is so “awfully fine,”
is entitled “Count Matatskai; or, The Bandit with the
Grey Beard: A Story from the Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Count Matatskai is a youthful nobleman who has fallen
in love with a mountain maiden, the beautiful but fierce
Krimhelia, daughter of a chamois-hunter. After various
meetings on the rocks by moonlight, with a faithful old
servitor <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">incognito</span></i> in the background, Krimhelia makes up
her mind to accept the Count’s love, and fly with him to a
distant country, where counts and the daughters of chamois-hunters
stand precisely on the same social footing. But
now a difficulty occurs, and it is this: Krimhelia has sworn
an oath to avenge the death of her father, who has been
killed in a fight with the band commanded by the Grey-Bearded
Brigand.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the point Jozef has reached in the story. Several
of his audience have already dropped asleep; but the reader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>does not notice it—he is too much absorbed in his narrative,—and
continues, in his “first-rate” manner, which—heard
at a distance—reminds one of nothing so much as of the
soft but continuous murmur of a babbling brook—commas
and other stops being, in this method, so entirely left in the
background, or else occurring in such remarkable places,
that a reporter would have been forced to reproduce his text
somewhat as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Krimhelia looked the Count straight in the face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at me Count said she do you see this glittering
dagger as sure as the moon, hangs yonder in heaven and
illuminates my pale features so surely will I thrust this,
dagger into the heart of the Bandit, with the Grey Beard first
and before I throw myself as your consort into your arms
but why so pale Count and why do you tremble so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Jozef is interrupted by the master-tailor, a thin, little
man, of whom it is commonly said on board that he knows
a thing or two more than most people.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, I know,” says he, in his piping voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’ye know?” asks the boatswain, who has little or
no opinion of the master-tailor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As how the gentleman—the Count, I mean—and the
other,—the Bandit with the Grey Beard,—that both of them
are one and the same man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you calico-spoiler—you know that, do you? Well—I
know that too, and all of us know it right enough; but
you needn’t take another man’s share in the reading for all
that. Go ahead, boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The master-tailor is looked at with contempt from various
quarters, and Jozef pursues his reading with a chapter
describing how Count Matatskai comes home in a bad
temper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Count threw himself down on a couch adorned
with costly velvet, relieve me of my riding-boots—thus he
spoke to the grey-headed old servant Gabario who, brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>him a silver goblet with sparkling wine saying, that this was
his favourite wine from the great vineyard south of the castle
but, the Count made a gesture of refusal with his left hand
and said me liketh no wine Gabario avaunt and saddle—my
horse!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the end of the chapter, and Jozef took breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a capital thing,” said the boatswain, “when a man
can have the things for the ordering in that way. What
comes next, Jozef?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boatswain is beginning to feel sleepy, and would
therefore like Jozef to tell him the end at once; but this
Jozef is by no means inclined to do,—he goes ahead
valiantly, and by degrees, though he does not observe it, his
whole audience drops asleep. At last, when he has reached
the closing scene, there is no one to listen to it but the
master-tailor, who can scarcely keep his small grey eyes
open.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just hear this, now!” says Jozef, who—though he has
read the book through twice before—is as enthusiastic over
this passage as the first time. “Now you must listen!
Now the Count is sitting up alone in the rocks, in a&nbsp;...
cavern, they call it,&nbsp;... and now he is the Bandit with the
Grey Beard; and the other robbers are sitting in the back of
the cavern round a great big fire, and some of them are
lying asleep, and the others are roasting great pieces of meat
at the fire, and they’re drinking wine with it&nbsp;... out of
gold cups that they’ve stolen.... But the Bandit with the
Grey Beard—&nbsp;... <em>he’s</em> sitting all by himself, you see,—and
now Krimhelia comes in—you know—the young lady he
thinks so much of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Jozef resumes his reading—how Krimhelia approaches,
cautiously, with the glittering dagger; how the
Grey-Bearded Bandit, looking up, suddenly sees her standing
behind him; how Krimhelia seizes him by the beard
and drives the dagger into his heart; and how, at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>moment, the long grey beard comes off in her hand, and
she looks with horror on the “pallid dying countenance” of
Count Matatskai.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now follows a dialogue between the dying bandit chief
and the “almost fainting” Krimhelia, who is “filled with
consternation”; in the course of which the tailor finally
closes his eyes unobserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now comes the closing scene; the other robbers come
out from behind the fire, Krimhelia takes to flight, and
climbs to the top of a steep dark rock on the edge of a
“yawning abyss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Jozef reads, he bends over his book, leans his head on
his hands, and sees the whole thing taking place before his
eyes. He sees Krimhelia standing on the top of the rock.
The day is breaking in the east. The robbers are pursuing
her, and begin to climb the rock....</p>

<p class='c009'>Jozef reads on,—at a passionately accelerated pace, and
with the most singular stops imaginable:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“There she stood proudly—like a queen with her long,
loose hair and her shining white face standing out sharply
against the red sunrise-tinted sky with horror—she saw in
the unfathomable depth at her feet the bandits approaching.
Already the foremost was stretching out his hand to seize
her and she saw, the morning-light falling on his horrible
features when suddenly, her ear was struck by a sound of
men’s voices singing beneath her in the valley she listens, it
is the morning song of her brothers, she lifts her hands skywards
and looks up to the paling moon and the stars ‘Ic-come’!
she cries” (all in one word) “... and with a
<span class='fss'>HOARSE</span> shriek she flings herself down into the abyss at
the same moment the Bandit Chief drew his last breath
and the Count Matatskai was no more <span class='fss'>THE END</span>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all!” said Jozef. “That’s fine, ain’t it?&nbsp;...
Oh! lor!&nbsp;... they’re all asleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jozef cannot at once get over a slight feeling of indignation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>against an audience, capable of dropping-off “in
the middle of a bit like that,”—but as it is not an isolated
experience on his part, he soon makes up his mind to pay
no further attention to it. He takes the lantern away, goes
forward, and lies down on the deck with the oil-stained book
under his head—looking up at the moon right above him,
and beginning to see, in the air, all sorts of figures, which
gradually acquire a likeness to Count Matatskai and the
“young lady he thinks so much of.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>FARMER GERRIT’S VISIT TO AMSTERDAM.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Gerrit Meeuwsen and his son Gijs, living in the depths of the
country, in the Betuwe district (the old Batavian Island, between the
Rhine and the Waal), have made up their minds—after long deliberation—for
an expedition by rail to the Amsterdam kermis. As they have
never left home before, preparations are made which suggest an Arctic
voyage, and they take a solemn farewell of their friends and relations.
The railway station is safely reached, after a drive of many miles; and
Gerrit severs the last link, so to speak, by sending back Jan—the farm-man—with
the trap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“G’morning,” said father and son, at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, friends,” replied the station clerk, who
was seated at a table doing sums.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meeuwsen took off his great woollen gloves, hauled out his
double-cased watch, and said, “Might it be about time for
the railway to come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know,” answered Gijs, who thought that his father
was asking the question of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clerk, a good-natured fellow, understanding that the
question was addressed to him, replied, “Oh! I suppose
you mean the <em>train</em>. Yes, that will be coming by very soon,—perhaps
in thirteen, or fourteen, or fifteen minutes. Where
do you want to go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Amsterdam,” replied Meeuwsen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Amsterdam—third-class?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Third-class, what’s that?” returned Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three classes, you know, my good friend,” the clerk
explained; “first, second, and third. The first is the dearest,
the second middling, and the third the cheapest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the third won’t do for us, nor the second neither,”
said Gerrit. “I always sit in the first seat at church in our
village, for I be churchwarden.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“First-class?” asked the clerk, in surprise, “but—do you
know——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never you mind; I want first-class, do you hear?” said
Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s all the same to me,” said the clerk, rising. He
went to the place where he kept the tickets, stamped two,
and received the rich Betuwers money.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracious! there’s the train!” cried the clerk, whose
calculation of fifteen minutes had been rather too liberal.
“Will you come out, please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerrit and Gijs, the latter carrying the carpet-bag, rushed
out on to the platform, followed by the clerk. The approaching
train seemed to the travellers to grow longer the more
they looked at it, and, when it stopped, both father and son
involuntarily took a step backwards.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither Gerrit nor Gijs knew exactly what happened to
them next; but when they got back all their senses,—for the
wind was blowing freshly in their faces,—they saw themselves
in a carriage containing, besides themselves, two other
passengers, and which allowed free passage to the wind on
all sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad weather for the money,” grumbled Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why! come and sit over here,” cried one of their
fellow-travellers, apparently a Jew, who was sitting on the
opposite side of the carriage, with his back to the engine.
“Sit here, on the first seat; you will be frozen to death
over there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerrit looked at his son, and then both stumbled along
the shaking carriage to the other end, and occupied the end
seats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a difference!” said Gijs, whose skin felt like that
of a plucked chicken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, this does shake!” said Meeuwsen. “No!—that
third-class is enough to kill one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nathan, who was reading a book, which, as Gerrit could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>see, seemed to begin at the end and go backwards, did not
speak again. The second travelling-companion had turned
up the collar of his thick overcoat and was snoring; and our
two gentlemen from Betuwe, having nothing to say to each
other, were silent, and thought—what, no one ever will
know.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a few minutes’ run, a conductor appeared—whence,
neither Gerrit nor Gijs could understand—and asked them,
“Where for, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Gentlemen!</em>” exclaimed Gerrit, with fine scorn, “<em>that</em>
won’t go down with us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Farmers, then!” said the conductor, “where for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meeuwsen thought the fellow had no manners, and said,
“I and my son for Amsterdam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Show your tickets, please,” said the conductor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meeuwsen began to search for them.... “I’d put them
away so carefully,” he remarked, while turning out all his
pockets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, never mind,” resumed the conductor (he was very
cold, and wanted to get back to his warm corner in the
closed compartment), “you can show me them presently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good,” replied Gerrit, who began to think the man
was not so bad after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conductor disappeared again, in the same mysterious
fashion, and Gerrit suddenly remembered that he had put
away the tickets inside his watch-case.</p>

<p class='c009'>At every station, when the whistle of the engine was
heard, Gijs was seized with consternation, thinking that a
child or some other living creature had been run over.
Every time the train stopped, the sons of Batavia prepared
to alight, and each time they were politely stopped by
Nathan, who told them they might just make their minds
easy, for they had not got there yet. Gijs thereupon came
to the conclusion that the journey would not be over so
soon as the schoolmaster had led them to suppose.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>At length, after they had left the last of the intermediate
stations behind, the mysterious conductor appeared once
more, and asked for the tickets; and Gerrit, who had kept
them carefully in his hand, under his woollen glove, produced
them, and gave them up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First-class!” said the conductor. “Why, man, you’ve
certainly had the best for your money!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hi?” said Meeuwsen, who could not understand what
the fellow meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stupid bumpkins!” muttered the conductor in an undertone,
happily inaudible to the Meeuwsens, and left the carriage
with a loud “Amsterdam, gentlemen!” The train
now stopped for good. Every one got out, and there was
such a row that Gerrit and his son could not understand what
was going on, and stood staring about them quite dazed.</p>

<p class='c009'>People, carriages, cabs, omnibuses, trunks, drivers with
brandished whips, crying, “This way, sir!—Hotel this!—Hotel
that!—just off!” There was such a swarming and
confusion that our travellers only regained their full consciousness
when they found themselves sitting in an omnibus,
packed, knee to knee, like herrings in a barrel,—and, probably,
dreaming—at least, so they thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where to, sir?” asked the conductor of the omnibus, in
a green coat trimmed with silver lace, of the person sitting
next the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Dam,” was the answer. “Botermarkt,” said
another passenger. “Rokin, No. 11,” said another; and
another followed with “The Mint.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir?” said the inquisitive man, addressing Gijs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I?” asked Gijs, staring wildly; “to the Fair, isn’t it,
father?”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the passengers laughed, except three or four who were
in a hurry to get to the Exchange.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be’st mad, I think, boy,” said Gerrit, grinning. “No,
mate,” he went on, addressing the conductor, “to a lodging.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Which hotel?” was then the question. “First, second,
third, fourth, fifth class? Rondeel, Doelen, Munt—or do
you want to go to the Nes?”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Whether Gerrit was thinking of the third-class carriage in
which he had been sitting with Gijs, and contrasting it with
the imaginary first-class where he found a place by the side
of Nathan, we do not know; but it is certain that he shivered
at the idea of a fifth-class, and had his answer ready at once—</p>

<p class='c009'>“First-class, man! First-class!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vieux</span> <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doelen!</span></i>” cried the conductor, with a smile and a
furtive wink at the passenger next the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The omnibus stopped, and Gerrit and Gijs were beckoned
to come out. How they ever got through the double row of
knees is quite incomprehensible; and twice did the heels of
Gijs’ heavy boots come unpleasantly in contact with corns,
whose proprietors, therefore, unkindly addressed him as
“Clumsy lout!” and “Dumb ass!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much is it?” asked Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conductor gave a look round, and then said, under
his breath—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only ten stivers<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> each, sir. I can’t ask you for more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meeuwsen gave him a florin, whereupon he asked whether
the gentleman couldn’t spare him a trifle for himself!</p>

<p class='c009'>This question was answered by the good-natured farmer
thrusting a <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kwartje</span></i><a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> into his hand; and the unscrupulous
rascal drove away, laughing in his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerrit, and Gijs with the carpet-bag on his back, stared
for a long time at the fine house, with the gilt letters on the
front; and at length ventured to go up the steps, though
they could not make up their minds to venture in.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“What do you want?” politely asked a handsome young
gentleman, in a snow-white waistcoat and a beautiful black
jacket, who came out of the broad hall and walked up to
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lodgings,” answered Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For yourself?” asked the young gentleman, who, seen
at close quarters, seemed older than his jacket would have
led one to suppose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I and my son Gijs,” said Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You?” again asked the young gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that so hard to understand?” asked the farmer.
“Are there no lodgings here? Can we get them, or can’t
we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young gentleman walked away, and stopped to speak
to another young gentleman like unto himself, who met him
in the corridor. Soon after two more arrived, one of them
with a napkin over his arm, and all the four began to laugh
immoderately; so that Gerrit began to be tired of waiting,
and, approaching the group, said, with some violence, “Now,
what is it to be? Are we to get rooms, or are we not?”
The young gentlemen continued to giggle, but suddenly
stopped, and scattered with surprising rapidity, for a dignified
elderly person entered the vestibule, and asked what was the
matter here. Whereupon Gerrit expounded to him that he
had asked, in a straightforward and downright way, for
lodgings; that he did not know what the young gentlemen
were up to; that he had come with his son to attend the
fair; that he had no mind to be what-you-may-call-ummed
and made a fool of by those young gentlemen; and that he
asked, once more, Could he, or could he not?</p>

<p class='c009'>The respectable gentleman took a good look at Gerrit and
Gijs—the latter was still outside the door with the carpet-bag—for
some moments; but the open honest face, and
generally prosperous appearance of the farmer, reassured him
as to the probability of their being good customers. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>then laid his forefinger against his nose, and called out to
one of the young gentlemen,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. 71 and 72, Karel. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Karel came. Gerrit beckoned Gijs to come in. Gijs also
came.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take the gentleman’s luggage,” said the proprietor of
the hotel to Karel, pointing to the carpet-bag, which Gijs
still carried over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! thank you,” said Gijs, as the young gentleman
Karel went about to relieve him of his load. Karel, however,
did not leave go. The proprietor was present; and, in
spite of Gijs’ asseverations that he was far too kind, he
seized the bag and flew up the broad staircase like a jumping
rabbit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you will follow, gentlemen,” said the proprietor, “the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i> will show you your rooms.” Gerrit, putting up, for the
sake of peace, with the title of gentleman, followed the flying
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i>, and Gijs followed his father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are we going to?” cried the stout farmer, to
whom climbing of stairs was an unaccustomed exercise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To No. 71 and 72,” said the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care what number it is—number thousand, if you
like—but I didn’t come here to climb up a tower!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall be there directly,” said Karel, still flying on
ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, then!” said Gerrit, taking courage; and on they
went again, up stairs and more stairs—there was no end to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we not there yet?” sighed Meeuwsen, when Gijs
had counted the forty-fifth flight of steps, and they had come
to an arched doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This way round!” cried Karel, and flew on, still higher.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! that’s too much; I give it up!” cried Gerrit, holding
fast to the banisters. “It’s enough to drive a man crazy!
I’ll go no farther.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only a few more,” said Karel persuasively. At last,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>when Gijs had counted sixty-three, the two, panting and
gasping, reached their goal—Nos. 71 and 72.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ici</span></i>,” said Karel, throwing open both doors almost at the
same moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ici</span></i> or no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ici</span></i>” muttered the farmer, “what I say is that
no decent man can be expected to do it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is your room,” said Karel, pointing to No. 72, as he
saw that Gijs was about to follow his father into No. 71.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I?” ejaculated Gijs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">S’il vous plaît</span></i>” said the waiter, and flinging the carpet-bag
into No. 71, he left the rooms, stood still in the passage
between the two apartments, and looking at father and son
by turns, went on, “Any more orders? Will the gentlemen
dine at the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span></i>, at half-past four?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gijs understood not a single word of this; and Gerrit, who
likewise did not grasp the subtleties of the situation,
answered shortly, “No,” being mortally afraid of having to
do any more climbing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Karel having had enough of this exalted society, uttered
no further questions or remarks, slammed both doors,
reached the ground floor by sliding down the banisters, and
left the father and son, each in his own room, to their
respective meditations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The well-furnished rooms were only divided from one
another by a thin wooden partition, and their windows
afforded a delightful view, to wit, a red-tiled roof, from which
arose a tall black chimney.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gijs looked round, like a cat in a strange warehouse, and
did not think Amsterdam so very beautiful after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boy! where are you?” shouted Gerrit. “What are we
to do now? Just come here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I do that, father?” roared Gijs, in a voice that
could easily have been heard in the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!” cried Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gijs went on tiptoe to his door, and, speeding as though
death were at his heels, out of No. 72 and into No. 71.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Look here, boy!” said Gerrit, when his son was safely
inside, “here we sit, and I’m so hungry that I can’t see
straight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I,” asseverated Gijs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you ought to call,” said his father, “and we might
order something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gijs muttered something about “so strange,” and “if
father were to do it himself,”—but, like a dutiful son, he
went to the stairs, and shouted—very much as he was
accustomed at home to call the calves to their food—“<em>Huup!
huup! huup!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>No one came. At last a door opened, and an old gentleman
in hat and greatcoat came out, and passed Gijs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Gijs, his shyness giving way before his own
hunger and his father’s orders, “would you be so kind as to
order something to eat for us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pull the bell, you young donkey!” was the polite reply.
The donkey departed without a word, and, after some
searching, Father Meeuwsen found a rope hanging in No.
71, at which he pulled,—and lo! they heard a bell ring. A
minute later Karel was again standing before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must bring us something to eat,” said the farmer, who
now began to understand that the young man was a waiter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Déjeuner à la fourchette?</span></i>” asked Karel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know those things,” replied Gerrit. “I’ve never
eaten <em>desernages</em>, nor <em>forzettes</em> either. Just bring us something,
my lad,—I don’t much care what, so long as we can
get something inside us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Flop went the door again; and five minutes later there
arrived at No. 71 some strange substances of whose nature
Gerrit and Gijs had not the remotest idea. They began,
however, to try and to taste, and though they could scarcely
get the things down their throats, they were messed up so
queerly with sweet stuff and spice, they managed to satisfy
their appetites somehow.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“I’ve had enough,” said Gerrit at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So have I,” sighed Gijs, and they rose from table,—to
go to the kermis.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will not relate in detail how Gerrit and Gijs climbed
downstairs again, went out at the front door, and announced
that they would come back again in the evening; how they
were besieged by beggars, shoeblacks, and Jews selling
lottery tickets,—nearly all of whom the good-natured farmer
succeeded in satisfying; how they were directed from one
part of the town to another, and back again, in order to
reach the fair; how and when they got there they found
booths, just like those in their own village, but much bigger
and finer ones. We will not record how much Gerrit paid
for the monster cake which he wished to take home to
Griet, and which bore the inscription, in sugar letters, “A
Fairing for You;” how Gijs was cheated in the purchase
of a cup and saucer for Mijntje; how they, furthermore,
bought ginger-bread, almonds, and who knows what
besides, so that their pockets stood out like hard lumps, and
they were nearly fainting under the weight of them. They
visited the circus, but were not edified; and when, finally,
the great trick rider “<em>Meseu</em> Blanus,” after two sudden
changes of costume, appeared in flesh-coloured tights, and
walked about blowing a trumpet, Gerrit could stand it no
longer, and seizing his son by the arm, he shouted, “That
beats all! so it does! come, boy, come! come!” and hurried
him out. When they had struggled out into the crowd
again, Gerrit said that they had had their fill of that sort of
thing, and more; and Gijs remarked that it was low. They
did not attempt to see any of the other shows, and Gerrit
unmercifully dragged Gijs past “The Mirror of Mystery,”
where, as the man at the door said, “The girl can see her
lover, and the young man his girl,—all for a <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dubbeltje</span></i>!
Great American Magic Mirror of Mystery!” Gijs would
have liked a peep at his Mijntje, but Gerrit was firm.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Having partaken, by way of refreshment, of hot wafers
and punch,—a repast which Gijs liked well enough, but his
father considered “sweet, but nothing to stay your stomach
on,”—they at last, after many wanderings, found their
way back to the hotel. The nimble rabbit, Mr Karel, was
again to the fore. In the twinkling of an eye he had lit a
candle, and flew up the stairs, requesting the wearied rustics,
unaccustomed to the hard walking of the streets, to follow
him, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">s’il vous plaît</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerrit and Gijs followed—yes! and in time they reached
the top, but felt just as if a thousand smiths were hammering
away in their bones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do the gentlemen wish <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souper</span></i>?” asked Karel, who by
this time had lit candles in each of the two rooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eat soup now!” said Gerrit, “get away with you! I’m
fair filled up with those wafer-cakes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put boots outside door—when d’you-want-to-be-called?”
asked Karel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going away to-morrow morning by the first train,”
said Gerrit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’ll want a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vigilante</span></i>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go to the&nbsp;... woodpile!” cried Gerrit, “with all your
foreign talk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, gentlemen!” said Karel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doors were shut, and the gentlemen were left alone.
Now began a conversation between the two—carried on in
genuine rustic growls, and yet as softly as if they were afraid
of waking “Mother my wife.” A few minutes later Gijs
retired, with a new blue wadded night-cap, and a “good-night,
dad,” to No. 72.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerrit had at once blown out the wax candles in No. 71.
“That’s just sinful waste,” he said; and Gijs, on entering
No. 72, followed his father’s example.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were not long in undressing by moonlight. Gijs
put on the night-cap, and stepped into the soft bed. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>a thing that was!—soft as pap!... Never knew such a
thing before.... He lay listening.... Every moment he
heard something&nbsp;... some one walking about&nbsp;... groping
among the furniture&nbsp;... at last speaking. At last, he
could stand it no longer—he sat up and stared uneasily
about. He thought he could plainly&nbsp;... hear&nbsp;...
something&nbsp;... at&nbsp;... the&nbsp;... door. Seemed as if&nbsp;...
you&nbsp;... could&nbsp;... see&nbsp;... the&nbsp;... handle&nbsp;... turning....
The perspiration broke out all over him&nbsp;...
still he saw it&nbsp;... plainly&nbsp;... and, when the door was
really opened, he uttered a yell, but slowly recovered himself
on seeing that it was his father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t rest on <em>that</em> thing,” said Gerrit, as he came in,
meaning the bed, which he found much too soft. “No,
Gijs, I’ll just come and lie here on the boards.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do that too,” said Gijs, stepping out of bed, and
then he lay down on the floor beside his father—each with
a pea-jacket rolled up for a pillow—“good-night! pleasant
dreams.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether the dreams were, in point of fact, pleasant may
be doubted, for they formed a first-class raree-show, composed
of bare legs and wafer-cakes, guns and horses, omnibuses,
and the climbing of towers, in wild confusion. Certain
it is, however, that the Meeuwsens, father and son, when they
awoke, stared at one another as if they had been bewitched,
and had to think a long time before they could remember
where on earth they were.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>Well, how did they get home again from the fair?—Gerrit
to his Griet, and Gijs to his Mijn.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very well indeed. Physically they were in sad case, but
spiritually all right—which does not always happen on like
occasions. The bill which Karel handed to Gerrit before
his departure was alike illegible to him and to Gijs. Perhaps
no one but the hotel-proprietor and the head-waiter could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>ever have deciphered it—only the total was clear: 16f. 80—accurately
reckoned. Gerrit thought, but said nothing;
paid; started, when he was told that a tip was expected of
him, over and above the bill, but paid it; and left the
Verdoel by the first omnibus, and Amsterdam by the first
train.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s over!” said Gerrit, sitting safe and sound once
more beside his Griet in the kitchen. “Once is well
enough—but never again! And I had everything first-class!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was true enough: for on the return journey he had
managed to get into the right compartment of the train—though,
to say the truth, he found it much less comfortable
than the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Gijs? Gijs was as blythe as a foal in the meadow,
when he found himself at home again. When he told Mijn
about the circus, and the young ladies in gilt caps who
had sold him wafers, and tried to flirt with him, she
turned as red as fire, and said it was scandalous; but
the cup and saucer, which, contrary to all expectation,
had reached home uninjured, were duly admired by her.
And when Gerrit, one fine evening, had some of the
neighbours in to help in the pig-killing, and entertained
them in the kitchen when work was over, the monster
cake was tasted, and Gerrit profited by the opportunity to
relate all his adventures. Then said Brother-in-Law Kresel,
that such a thing hadn’t happened within the memory of
man!—and Baas Janssen, that morality was getting into a
frightful state!—and the old Teunis farmer concluded,
“What does a man want on the ice in his clogs?”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>NO SWORD!</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Old Colonel H—— was standing, during one of the summer
months, before the open window, puffing the smoke of his
Havannah into the air, with the feeling of satisfaction produced
by a fine day, while his eyes followed the movements
of a young officer, whose elastic figure had already, at some
distance, attracted his superior’s attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly his face darkened. No one so soon feels his
toes trodden on as an old military man.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was that? Were his eyes dazzled by the sunlight?
Or could anything of the sort possibly happen under the
eye of the strict commanding officer of the regiment? Had
discipline really died out among the younger generation of
the army?</p>

<p class='c009'>No, it was no optical deception. He could see it now,
plainly—the lieutenant, passing there, on the other side of
the street, with a letter in his hand, had <em>no</em> sword on!
And it was not nearly four <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lieutenant!” cried the fire-eater, in a momentary
ebullition of indignation, from the open window; “if I may
ask you—one moment!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man addressed immediately turned with a military
salute, and hastened to the Colonel’s rooms, without the
slightest presentiment of the storm about to burst over his
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>He rang the bell, and the Colonel’s servant opened the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing through the hall, he gave a hasty glance at his
uniform to see whether it was all right—and then he discovered
his misfortune. Horrible! He had, in his haste
to post a letter, forgotten to buckle on his sword!</p>

<p class='c009'>For one moment he hesitated; he was really frightened,
and saw, looming up in space, all the evil consequences of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>his mistake, in the form of all possible reports, with “arrest”
at the end of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Colonel would send a note to the commander of
division, who would endorse and put it into the hands of
the captain—and then the fat would be in the fire with a
vengeance! All this passed like a flash of lightning through
the unhappy man’s head, and he looked helplessly round,
as though hoping that some good genius would inspire him
with a way of escape in this sore need. What was he
to do? He could not keep the cantankerous Colonel waiting,—there
was nothing for it except to march valiantly
forward into the lion’s den. But luck never forsakes a
lieutenant!</p>

<p class='c009'>What is that glittering over there in the umbrella-stand?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Colonel’s sword!... He pulls out his purse,—thrusts,
with an eloquent gesture, a guilder into the hand of
the Colonel’s man, and buckles on the sword—all in less
time than it takes to tell it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later he stands—in correct military attitude, his
left hand held so as to hide the dragon on his sword-hilt
from the eagle eye of his chief—before the old gentleman,
who, meanwhile, has been stalking up and down the room,
fretting and fuming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir! I must call your attention to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>A long pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Colonel’s glance travels from the sword to the young
officer’s blushing face, and back again to the glittering weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he shakes his head in utter amazement, but
recovers himself speedily, and continues in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What battalion do you belong to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The second, Colonel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just so. I only wanted to ask you if—if—Major Ij&nbsp;...
has returned from his leave?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is not coming back till to-morrow, sir, if I have
understood rightly.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Ah!—thank you—it had escaped me—thanks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lieutenant saluted respectfully, left the room with
the greatest air of self-confidence, hastened down the stairs,
unbuckled the Colonel’s sword—put it away noiselessly
among the sticks and umbrellas, after which he hurried
away, keeping as close as he could to the wall till he was
out of sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the Colonel, he simply could not believe his eyes!
Then something occurred to him. He called his man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you let the lieutenant in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was he wearing a sword when he came in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” answered he, with imperturbable calm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Colonel smote his forehead with his open hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lieutenant’s guilder was well invested.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>A STUDENT’S LODGINGS SIXTY YEARS SINCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The burghers of the university town—at least those whose
houses, at the beginning of the summer vacation, are adorned
with cards bearing the inscription “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cubicula locanda</span></i>”—can,
during nine months of the year, be looked on only to a
limited extent as masters in their own dwellings. It is the
student, or the officer, as the case may be, who is established
in the best room, who attracts all the attention of passers by,
and the neighbours over the way,—who sits at the window,
is seen to go in and out at the front door, carries the key,
rules, gives orders, receives his friends and acquaintances,
and, in a word, conducts himself as the principal person,
while the owner or lessee of the house is banished to a back
room or some little subterraneous den in the basement. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>is to the best room, then, that we must make our way,
though the approach to it is not an attractive one. Our
way lies, first, through a narrow passage, where we run the
risk of stumbling over a doorstep, evidently placed there
with the sole object of teaching children and visitors to be
careful of their steps. Then we have to seek a dark and
narrow stairway, and, having found it, to ascend it. It
receives, by day, only a dim and doubtful light from the
basement; by night, it is perfectly dark, and its worn and
slippery steps follow one another at such strangely unequal
intervals, that one is tempted to think the architect must
have been interested in the problem how to pile on one
another, in a given space, a given number of irregular
parallelograms in the most heterogeneous manner possible.
When we have succeeded, after having knocked our heads
not more than three or four times against all sorts of
fantastically projecting rafters and angles, in reaching what
is ironically called the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bel étage</span></i>, we find ourselves in front of
a door which opens very easily and noiselessly, but can
never be closed without five or six violent thrusts or tugs,
according as you are inside or out. We once more hit our
toes against an unexpected doorstep, and at last enter the first
of the two rooms inhabited by <em>Gerlof Bol, S.S. Theol. cand</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is evening; the two sash windows, divided by a narrow
space of wall, are hidden behind unpainted shutters, on
which, here and there, a square, worm-eaten, or dirt-stained
spot shows where a hasp or bolt has been, but is no more.
These shutters curve outwards, and threaten every moment
to escape from the control of the bars (bent crooked as
though with their weight), and fling themselves in the
face of the incautious person who should venture too
near. The walls are covered with a dirty yellow paper, on
which green and blue flowers alternate in diagonal lines.
Now and then, where the paper has been torn, another piece
of the same pattern has been pasted on upside down, probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>for the sake of securing a pleasing variety; while in
other cases the damage has not been repaired, and an
earlier wall decoration, in orange and black, is apparent in
patches. On the wall hang the portraits of Van Der Palm
and Borgen<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> in one frame, the lecture list, fastened up with
three pins, and a variety of college notices secured in the
same way. Near the door is a tolerably roomy alcove, containing
the occupant’s chief treasures,—in the first place, his
books, which, in so far as they consist of quartos, octavos,
and duodecimos, are ranged on three shelves against the
wall, while the folios stand on the ground in the company
of sundry maps in cases; in the second place, two baskets,
one of which is full of burnt-out clay pipes, the other of
foul ditto awaiting their burning. Item, a closed card-table,
bought cheap at a second-hand dealer’s, which can
never stand on more than two legs at the same time; while
the superficies of the once green baize with which it is
covered offers a remarkable assemblage of mathematical
figures, such as circles formed by the setting down of wet
punch or wine glasses, ellipses or squares arising from the
dropping of wax, grease, or ink, or the contact with various
objects not previously dusted. Item, an umbrella without
a knob, whose whalebone ribs, for the most part,
have either repudiated all connection with the covering,
or shamelessly protrude through it. Furthermore, a trio
of eccentric-looking canes, a couple of broken German
pipes, a little tin box, a small writing-desk heaped with
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictata</span></i>, MS. notes, and dilapidated books; a large reading
desk, holding the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">editio princeps</span></i> of the States Bible;<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and,
<em>last not least</em>, as the English say, a small basket containing
full, and a large one with empty, wine bottles.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The said alcove is provided with a double door, and
when the latter is closed, peculiar skill, or else a lucky conjuncture
of circumstances, is necessary to open it, seeing
that the handle usually displays a remarkable degree of
obstinacy, and calmly turns round in one’s hand unnumbered
times without lifting the latch.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to the other furniture of the room, the following is an
accurate inventory:—</p>

<p class='c009'>1. A small mirror in a polished wooden frame,—the glass
consisting of two sections, each of a different colour. If
you see yourself in the lower half you have a purple countenance,
in the upper a green one, and in either case your
features are cruelly distorted; in fact, no one ever looked
into this mirror, either above or below, who did not
instantly look out of it again,—so frightfully ugly does every
one find him or herself, as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. A mahogany sécretaire, which, though it has lost some
of the convolutions of the carved fretwork finishing it off
at the top, is still, on the whole, tolerably fit for use, and has
no other defects than these, that the lower drawer will not shut,
that one of the hinges of the flap is loose,—necessitating great
care in opening and closing,—and that one of the feet has
long ago declined further service and preferred a horizontal
to an upright position,—in spite of which, however, the article
of furniture can be made to stand tolerably steady if propped
up against the wall. On the top stands a bunch of paper
flowers (the landlady’s property), protected by a glass shade,
flanked to right and left by plaster busts of Homer and
Cicero, and surrounded with several teacups, bearing in gilt
letters such touching mottoes as “Many happy returns of
the day,” “A trifle—but a token of good-will,” “Walk on
roses,” “A token of respect,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. A white-wood corner cupboard, with a fluted sliding-door,
which, if you go about to open it quietly, refuses to
move, whereas if you use force you push the whole cupboard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>from its place. Only long experience, added to unwearying patience, will enable any one to bring to light the
glasses, plates, and knives, or whatever the contents of the
receptacle may be.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. A tiled stove, whose top is pointed out as a frequent
resting-place for glasses by a variety of circular stains.
Next the stove stands a wooden tub containing coals, and
behind it lie a heap of peats and a few blocks of wood, also
a poker and tongs. The latter cannot be handled without
pinching the skin of one’s forefinger, and the legs slip across
each other as soon as one tries to pick up anything with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. An arm-chair, and six chairs with plush seats, showing
their stuffing through numerous wounds,—all of them
venerable invalids, full of infirmities, and especially weak in
the back.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. A square table, with flaps which can be turned up; its
upper surface painted green with white spots, and the edges
reddish-brown. In the middle of this table we see a lamp
and two black-japanned candlesticks with tallow candles in
them; further, a broken pair of snuffers, a wooden tobacco-box,
a brazier, and an inkstand with other writing materials;
and round it are seated several students, all members of
the “rhetorical chamber”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> entitled, “The Thirsty
Pleiades.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“Another day on the rack!” Heer Doornik had said that
morning to his wife,—not however in so tragic a manner as
the tenor of the ejaculation would seem to indicate, as he was
just then busy pulling on a particularly intractable boot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is your speech ready?” asked Mevrouw Doornik, in
the act of fastening his necktie for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my address is prepared,” he replied, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>You must know, reader, that Doornik had been, in his
young days, a member of a “rhetorical chamber” at Dinxperlo
or Buren, I do not exactly remember which, and had
reaped harvests of laurels at various lectures—laurels offered
to him along with cups of muddy chocolate and <em>cadetjes</em> with
cream cheese.</p>

<p class='c009'>This circumstance had stood in his way all his life. The
man, whose manifest destiny was to become a schoolmaster,
believed himself a second Mirabeau. He would
have liked to become a popular orator, or a member of the
Second Chamber, or failing that at least a minister. But his
ideals had gone the way of the <em>cadetjes</em> and the chocolate,
they had vanished into nothingness; the future Mirabeau
became, first, a pupil in a training-college, then third, and
then second master; and, at last, with much labour, he
gained his head-mastership.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have at last this consolation, that I am to-day once
more placed in a position to show the public what the art of
oratory is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This last sentence was uttered with such an elevation of
his voice, that his wife thought it necessary to damp his
enthusiasm a little.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid the pine-apple tartlets are burnt,” she said,
“and the cabinet-pudding, too, is not as it should be.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>But her husband did not hear her. In one hand he had
a hair-brush and in the other a comb, and with these objects
he went through all sorts of evolutions, his eyes fixed on the
mirror, and his long figure most eccentrically contorted.
His wife left him alone; she was well acquainted with this
manœuvre, and twenty years’ experience of married life had
taught her not to disturb her husband when seized by
inspirations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Indies are not the place for unappreciated genius;
all that they could give the great man (except a good salary
and an easy life, which, of course, did not count) was the
chairmanship of a few committees, and a place in the church
council and other assemblies, which got through more talking
than business. Besides this, he was a Freemason, and thus
at last he had the satisfaction of being able to speak “in
public,” taking one week with another, at least once a week.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day of the school examination was therefore, in his
opinion, especially suited to this purpose, and he had not
practised so long for nothing. His speech was going to be
brilliant, his eloquence indescribable, his gestures and facial
expression would do the rest. It was only a pity that
Hendriks (the second master) had come to worry him, for,
above all things, he needed quiet in those days when he
was going to show the public what good speaking is.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the proceedings were to begin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The children sang one or two songs very prettily, and the
effect would have been exceedingly good, had not the head-master
been of opinion that his voice—not a bad one, but
just now fairly hoarse with nervousness—ought to be heard
above all the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the examination proper began, and the usual
incidents took place. Great exhibitions of dumbness on the
part of the girls, fearful embarrassment on that of the boys,
extreme exasperation among the masters, suppressed giggling
among the ladies of the audience, and unnaturally solemn
faces among the members of the school committee, who had
evidently made up their minds to remain serious whatever
might happen.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“IN ONE HAND A HAIR-BRUSH, IN THE OTHER A COMB.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>In the first-class sat eight boys, between the ages of twelve
and fifteen. But it soon became apparent that six of the
eight were mere lay figures; the questions were addressed
to all, but the answers, evidently, expected from Anton van
Duijn and William Ochtenraat only.</p>

<p class='c009'>They represented two distinct types, as they sat there side
by side. William had a fresh, rosy face, large blue eyes,
and a white forehead, crowned with blonde curls,—he was a
prize specimen of a Dutch boy. Anton, with his dark hair
and jet-black eyes, clear-cut brown face, and tall slight
figure, was a handsome <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">sinjo</span></i>; for he had inherited his looks
more from his Creole mother than his Dutch father.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mevrouw Ochtenraat had spoken truth when she assured
Mevrouw van Duijn just now that it gave her much pleasure
to see how clever and hard-working Anton was.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day, however, it seemed as though Anton did not
know so much more than his schoolfellow. Was it the fault
of the questions put by the master, who seemed still more
agitated than common, and became so amazingly tragic in
his simplest movements and gestures that he seemed to be
reciting one of Racine’s tragedies rather than conducting a
school examination?</p>

<p class='c009'>Or was it the way the master knitted his brows and rolled
his eyes, wriggled and writhed and stretched himself, that
confused Anton?</p>

<p class='c009'>Or could it have been the little piece of paper that had
just been put into his hand, and on which Heer Hendriks
had written in pencil, “Keep cool, don’t let them make you
lose your head!”—could that have been the reason why
Anton every now and then failed to answer a question?</p>

<p class='c009'>William Ochtenraat, on the other hand, seemed in particularly
good spirits that morning. Again and again the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>master managed to bring him round to one or other of the
few subjects in which he was at home. He made him tell
the story of Alexander the Great’s horse, and of the faithful
hound who died on the grave of William the Silent, and,
finally, of the turf-boat by means of which Breda was surprised.
William’s eyes sparkled as he told of Bucephalus;
and his mother would have liked to kiss him when he
nearly choked over William of Orange’s dog; and when he
laughed over the discomfiture of the Spaniards, the whole
room laughed with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, poor Anton became more and more uneasy;
he no longer nodded encouragingly to his mother, as he had
done at first, but his anxious looks sought Heer Hendriks,
who was quite as pale as he.</p>

<p class='c009'>The arithmetic began. Here dogs, horses, and jokes
were alike out of place; the thing, therefore, was to ask the
Governor’s son as few questions as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I shall be all right!” thought Anton; for this was
the subject in which he most excelled. But even now things
continued to go wrong; time after time he found he could
not answer, and something began to glitter in his eyes which
ought to have warned Heer Doornik.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the master put a question. And the boy cried,
pale with that terrible bluish paleness one only sees where
there is coloured blood,—“I can’t answer that question, sir;
and you know I can’t, because it’s not on what I’ve learned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But perhaps one of the other boys can,—William, for
instance?” asked Hendriks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no,” cried Willie, “I never heard of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Heer Doornik—in spite of his fondness for speeches in
general—was far from pleased with this speech; he understood
how every one must feel that there was something
behind this, and shortly afterwards brought the examination
to a somewhat precipitate close by giving his wife the sign
to order up the refreshments.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Whoever else may have taken bread and butter, or pine-apple
tart,—whoever else was regaled with the cabinet-pudding,—neither
Anton nor his mother tasted them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be uneasy, madam,” said the Governor, to the
widow, as he called one of the boys to bring her a glass of
wine and water, seeing that she trembled in every limb.
“Don’t be uneasy, Anton is sure to get the prize.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The examination was over, the bread and butter and
cakes had disappeared, the scholars having displayed in
their extermination a far greater zeal and endurance than in
the ordeal of answering questions. Now came the distribution
of prizes, and—the Speech!</p>

<p class='c009'>Many a time had people seen Heer Doornik nervous, and
heard him get entangled in his sentences, but the display he
made to-day was absolutely unprecedented.</p>

<p class='c009'>The oration lasted fully a quarter of an hour, and it was
not the heat alone which made the ladies look so flushed
and uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some new-comers to the place were seriously alarmed lest
the man should break a blood-vessel, or dislocate his left
arm,—which came in for the hardest of the work,—or lose
his balance in some of his sudden evolutions; the children
sat staring at him open-mouthed, the gentlemen nudged one
another, the ladies effaced themselves more and more behind
their colossal fans. Mevrouw Doornik, alone, sat with her
hands folded in her lap, gazing in silent admiration at the
man of her choice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Widow Van Duijn, too, was listening in the greatest
excitement, till she felt he was going beyond her comprehension
altogether; and Anton stood, never taking his
burning eyes from the master’s face, waiting for his sentence.</p>

<p class='c009'>It came at last, after many a long circuit. Considering
this, and weighing that, and giving its due prominence to
this circumstance, and noticing why, and not forgetting how
the two boys in the first-class, who alone had any claim to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the prize, had learned what they had learned, and answered
as they had answered, he thought he was acting in harmony
with the esteemed head of the government, and all the
gentlemen and ladies who had honoured the school with
their presence, by handing the first prize herewith to the
most industrious and highly gifted pupil—William Ochtenraat!</p>

<p class='c009'>Therewith he handed the boy a handsomely bound book,
with a gesture so powerful, so violent a swaying of his whole
person, that one was reminded of Samson at the moment
when he seized the pillars of the temple.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a sudden stillness in the spacious school
building. The master looked at the Governor. The latter
let his glance rest on William, who, more amazed than
delighted, looked first at the glittering volume, and then
at the deathly pale boy who sat next him, motionless, with
clenched fists and set teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already Heer Doornik, mopping his face all the time with
his handkerchief, was approaching the prize-winner to offer
his congratulations,—already there were sounds of sniffling
and rustling, caused by ladies and gentlemen rising to
congratulate the parents, when Heer Ochtenraat slowly rose
in his place, and, with a quiet gesture of his delicate white
hand, asked for a hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more there was silence as of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“William,” said the Governor, in his clear, resonant voice,
“William, tell me honestly, have you earned that prize?”</p>

<p class='c009'>One moment the boy hesitated, with a glance at the book.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, papa!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my boy, give the book to the one who has earned
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without stopping to think for one moment, the boy went
up to Anton van Duijn, and put the book into his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>It needs a good deal to excite an East Indian audience,
but when Heer Hendriks, with a pale face, and a suspicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>look of moisture about his eyes, made his way forward,
wrung Anton’s hand, and cried aloud, “Hurrah! three
cheers for the Governor,” the universal enthusiasm found
vent in long and loud cheering. Heer Ochtenraat immediately
rose to go; he looked at the head-master coldly and
sternly, and passed him without a word.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><em>HOW MATHIS KNOUPS TURNED “LIBERAL” AND THEN “CATHOLIC” AGAIN.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Every one in Limburg who is not “Catholic” is “liberal”—that
is an established fact. There may be a few Protestants
here and there; but these are <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gueux</span></i>, interlopers, mostly
from the direction of Hertogenbosch, and therefore Hollanders,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
who have accidentally come into the country at
one time or another. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gueux</span></i> means one who has fallen
away from the Roman Catholic faith, and therefore from
Christianity. Also, among other rarities, one finds here
and there a few Jews; but they, of course, do not count.
A “liberal” is one who is not always and altogether of the
same opinion as the parish priest and his <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kapelaan</span></i> (curate)—outside
church matters, that is to say, for if he were to
differ from their reverences on any point of doctrine, he
would be no liberal, but a heretic. Also that person is a
liberal who, for instance, may, on occasion, give his opinion of
a sermon thus,—“Oh! yes, they”—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, the clergy—“must
find something to talk about, I suppose.” Or likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>he who, instead of going regularly to high mass, contents
himself, on Sundays and festivals, with a “snap-mass,”—a
little, short service; or he who dares to declare, with a
smile, that he cannot think how all the fast-days came into
existence. There are indeed even a few, but only a few, and
those only to be found in towns, who recognise no fast-days
at all, entirely godless and irreligious people, who never go to
church, and do not even attend confession at Easter. Such
people as those are worse than any liberals or heretics,—they
are, in one word, <em>bad</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus, whoever is not a liberal is a Catholic; but there
are <em>Catholics</em>, and <em>good Catholics</em>. A Catholic is any man
who faithfully performs his religious duties; who would not,
for any money, presume to differ in opinion from the parish
priest, and never asks whence that gentleman gets the text of
his sermons, or how the church fasts originated. But any
one who, in addition to all this, also walks in procession
with a lighted torch or leads the prayers as master of the
confraternity of St Joseph or St Rochus, who duly informs the
villagers whom the priest would like elected into the parish
council, who comes to the Holy Communion at least once a
month, and, in the tavern, of an evening, can describe all
liberals, gueux, freemasons, and all such like rabble, in their
true colours, that man is a good <em>Catholic</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mathis Knoups, master-carpenter, and landlord of the
“Sun” at Haffert, did not belong to this category; he was a
Catholic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout court</span></i>. He went to high mass on Sundays, and
four times in the year to confession. This, he said, was
doing no more than his duty; and, for the rest, he had
no time to take any further trouble about the church or
religion,—every man must know what he is about, and he
had to think of his children.... There were plenty of
other men to carry torches in the procession,—fast-days had
always existed, and did not seem to have made people
leaner or less healthy,—and he was willing to take for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>granted that what M. le Curé said in his sermons was true,
provided he were not obliged to listen to them. Also, he
was quite ready to vote for Jan, Piet, or Klaas, just as M.
le Curé pleased,—he had no quarrel with any of the three,
and so it was all the same to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was Knoups’ way of reasoning, when the question
was discussed by the guests who came to take their evening
glass of beer at the “Sun.” On such occasions, the
surveyor Hommels, well known in the town for a “great
liberal,” would usually answer, “Yes, yes, you village
people let yourselves be finely humbugged and led by the
nose!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Lord!” Knoups would then retort, “you have
been bitten by that dog too!” And then, with a smile of
complete assurance and self-satisfaction, he would add, “One
has to keep one’s soul clean, you see!” Whereupon the
ex-burgomaster Kormann would signify his approval in the
words,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, Master Knoups! the man who does not
need that, is not called on to take any trouble about it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then don’t let him trouble himself with my affairs,”
answered Knoups.</p>

<p class='c009'>Master Knoups’ inn was about twenty minutes’ walk from
the little town, at the point where the “<span lang="fy" xml:lang="fy">grintweg</span>” leading to
Haffert branches off from the high-road. Among the other
advantages of this situation was a toll-gate, which was farmed
by Mathis. What Limburg carter would not willingly turn
in for a half-pint of beer or a dram, at the place where he
has to stop and pay “barrière”? Thus the “Sun” was
always full of “coming and going folk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups let his wife attend to the taproom and the toll-gate;
he himself was all day long in his workshop, when
not busy on his bit of land. Well, Geutruu (Gertrude)
was a handy woman, who helped him to provide for the
children, had a pleasant word for every one,—if there was a
cent to be earned anyhow,—but who let no one steal the
cheese off her bread.</p>

<p>“M. LE CURÉ.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>In the evening there assembled at the “Sun” the “permanent
company”—the ex-burgomaster Kormann of
Haffert, the surveyor Hommels, Spinwek the baker, and
one or two other gentlemen from the town, who would sit
playing at cards, sometimes till eleven, and frequently asked
the landlord to take a hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides the field, the carpenter’s trade, the toll-gate, and
the usual custom of the inn, there was another great annual
source of income, the Haffert kermis (fair) at St Rochustide
in August, when the burghers with their wives and
daughters, and the young men from the city, streamed to
the village for three days following. And the man who did
not put up at the “Sun” had not been at the Haffert kermis.</p>

<p class='c009'>If on these occasions Knoups did not, taking one day
with another, tap his six casks of beer per day, he had
every reason to shake his head, pass his thumb over his
forefinger as though he had been counting money, drop his
under-lip, and sigh:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s bad times with people,&nbsp;... they’re short of money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Knoups,” Hommels had sometimes said to him, “you
ought to have dance-music at St Rochus. Then you might
tap ten casks in a day, or even twelve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups looked serious, pulled somewhat harder at his
pipe, considered for a moment, and replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thirty casks!&nbsp;... it would be a good deal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next year, having used up twenty casks in the three days,
he said to Geutruu:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wife, we must have the dancing next year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know best, I suppose,” said Geutruu; “every cask
counts. But what will the Pastoor say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whereto Knoups replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, every one ought to know what he’s about, and I
have to think of the children.”</p>

<p>“THEIR EVENING GLASS OF BEER AT THE ‘SUN.’”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Next year there was music and dancing at the “Sun,”
and some forty-two casks of beer were tapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups and Geutruu laughed in their sleeves.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the same, it had been a frightful moment for them,
when they sat side by side at early mass, and the Curé had
preached against dancing, and hinted at the risks run as
regards the next world by those who took part in such
amusements. Geutruu did not know where to hide her
head for shame, and kept bending lower and lower over her
prayer-book. Mathis cast a furious glance at the preacher,
but the latter stared at the couple till the whole congregation
had turned their eyes in their direction; and Mathis himself
at last, fiery red at one moment and deadly pale the next,
cast down his eyes and bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now that he and Geutruu were home again, and
counting the Brabant and Prussian cents—the groschen,
half-francs, and <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">couranten</span></i>—which went to make up the payment
for forty-two casks of beer, he exploded with laughter,
and said, pointing to the money:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Geutruu, the Curé may give us another sermon for that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, the people from the town had never troubled their
heads about the Curé of Haffert’s preaching, and the peasants
said, “If the burghers dance, why should we keep away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>When All Saints’ Day came, Mathis and Geutruu went
to confession as usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he speaks about the dancing, we’ll say that we don’t
know yet what we’re going to do next year,” said Mathis at
the church door.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, it was not so easy to get absolution. The Curé
was terribly angry, and the confession lasted more than half-an-hour;
however, for this once, his reverence at last showed
himself willing to lean to the side of mercy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” he added, “if you let the devil loose in my parish
again next year, I can do nothing more for you.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>
<img src='images/i_219.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“THE CURÉ MAY GIVE US ANOTHER SERMON FOR THAT.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>At Christmas, Easter, and Ascensiontide they again went
to confession, but on none of these occasions was anything
said about dancing.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the beginning of August, a fortnight before St Roch’s
Day, Mathis said to his wife:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wife, we must have the dancing again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know best,” answered Geutruu, as before; “but
what will M. le Curé say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>To which he gave the same answer as last year.</p>

<p class='c009'>And there was dancing at the “Sun.” The Curé preached
with all his might, but the townspeople went first and the
peasants followed, and no less than forty-five casks of beer
were consumed at the “Sun.” Such a thing had not happened
anywhere in the neighbourhood within the memory
of man.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, alas! for the following All Saints’ Day. As soon as
the Curé caught sight of Mathis Knoups through the grating
of the confessional, he closed the slide in his face. Geutruu
received absolution, after many entreaties and arguments,
because she could plead that she had warned her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s his own business,” said Mathis; “every one
must know what he is about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Henceforth Knoups went to confession only once a year—at
Easter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Once is a man’s duty,” said he; “but to be turned
away four times in the year is only mere waste of time and
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the wicket was shut in his face. Hommels, in the
tavern parlour that evening, laughed over it, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, M. le Curé keeps you all in order like a flock of
sheep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups smiled, and replied, shortly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The stayer wins. We shall see who’ll hold out longest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These strained relations between Knoups and the Curé
lasted some four or five years, and then another incident
occurred.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Hubertienke, Knoups’ eldest girl, was now nine, and went
to school at Haffert. The master said that she was one of
the cleverest and best-behaved children that had ever come
under his care. And now that she went twice a week to
M. le Chapelain’s “Christian doctrine” class, it was quite
likely that next St Rochus’ Day she would walk with the
other children as a “little bride” in the procession, and
carry a little flag, a shepherd’s crook, perhaps even a cornucopia,
or a great crimson heart with gold flames. The child
had talked and dreamed of this possibility for a whole year
or so, and Geutruu had had a little white dress and white
satin shoes made for her in town, and bought a wreath of
May-blossom from the milliner.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Geutruu and her little daughter had reckoned without
their host—that is to say, without the Curé. Two days
before St Rochus, his reverence had sent for Vrouw Knoups,
and asked her whether Mathis was going to have the dance-music
again. Whereupon, embarrassed and confused, she
had answered, “I think so, M. le Curé.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then Hubertine can’t walk in the procession,” was the
Curé’s verdict. “If the father doesn’t keep his Easter, the
child can’t be a ‘little bride.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Geutruu came home with the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad luck to the whole thing!” raged Mathis. “Geutruu,
you dress the child properly, and take her to the
church. We’ll see what the Curé does then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife did as he had said—dressed the child in the
white frock, put on the satin shoes, and fastened the wreath
into her hair. Then she went with Hubertienke to high
mass, and when the procession started Hubertienke took
her place with the other children of the “catechising.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely however had the procession got out of the
church, and reached the market-place, when the Curé entered
the ranks of the “little brides,” took Hubertienke by the
hand, and made the child take her place behind the file of
school children who did not yet come to “Christian
doctrine,” and were posted a long way in advance at the
head of the procession, in their black or dark blue Sunday
frocks.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“DRESSED THE CHILD IN THE WHITE FROCK.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>All this was clearly seen by Mathis Knoups, standing
among the crowd of spectators. He rushed up, looking
daggers, fetched his child out of the procession, and, grinding
his teeth, made his way homewards with Hubertienke.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could scarcely eat his dinner for the next three days.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Hommels began touching on the occurrence in the
evening, Mathis cried, his lips trembling:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine religion that! As he can’t be revenged on me, he
wreaks his spite on my child! If that’s our religion, I’d
rather not have no more religion at all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>From that day forth the publican-carpenter went neither
to church nor to confession, not even at Easter, and was in
the eyes of every one “a downright liberal.” At the
elections, he filled in his voting ticket with his own name.
When Hommels abused the Curé, and scoffed at religion,
then Knoups laughed till he shook all over. And when the
ex-burgomaster Kormann exhorted him to return to the
bosom of Holy Church, Mathis would answer:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Paja!</em> the whole business isn’t worth a cent!” or,
“Mind your own business, and let me attend to mine—every
one ought to know what he’s about!”</p>

<p class='c009'>That every one ought to know his own business best, he
maintained with equal consistency when Geutruu went with
Hubertienke and the other children to church on Sundays.
Hommels, indeed, laughed at this curious compromise
between man and wife; but Geutruu would reply, when
teased on the subject:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t bring up the children like heathen savages,
can I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The breach between Mathis Knoups and the Church had
lasted quite three years, when, one baking day in July, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>lightning struck Haffert church, and the whole roof was
burnt off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups looked important and thoughtful, as he remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to know who’s going to put the new roof
on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I suppose the Curé will somehow beg the money
for it!” said Hommels, who did not exactly see the connection.</p>

<p class='c009'>The thought of the new roof pursued Mathis night and
day. He knew very well how <em>he</em> would do it—he had some
choice timber lying by that would just do—he trimmed the
rafters—he made all sorts of calculations, and was able to
tell his guests to a cent that evening how much the new
roof ought to cost—not an <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">oortje</span></i><a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> more. But, when talking to
his wife alone, he said, half vexed and half sad:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Curé is sure to take care to get another builder into
Haffert this time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A week before St Rochus, Knoups went to the brewer in
the town to order the <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kermis</span></i> beer for the dancing-tent as
usual. There was no brewery at Haffert, or Knoups would
certainly not have gone outside the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have nothing but new beer for you, Master Knoups,”
said the brewer; “you will find there’s going to be sharp
competition this year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How so?” asked Knoups.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you know, don’t you, that Stamel-Joob has rented
the piece of land just opposite your house, on the other side
of the Haffert road?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups nodded an affirmative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stammering Joob is going into partnership with Crippled
Manes, and they mean to get a big dancing-tent over from
Prussia, and set it up there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlord of the “Sun” stared at the brewer with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>his eyes. He was vainly seeking for arguments to combat
his own inner conviction that Stammering Joob the never-sober
host of the “City of Algiers,” and Crippled Manes the
recruiting-sergeant, who also did a good business as a kind
of broker in procuring substitutes for unwilling conscripts,
were two dangerous opponents, and capable of anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where should they get the money from?” he suddenly
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The brewer shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mathis became lost in thought for some minutes, and at
last whispered, looking at his purveyor with flashing eyes,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think the Curé of Haffert could be mixed up in
this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more the brewer shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All that I know,” said he, “is that Stammering Joob and
Crippled Manes have ordered sixty casks of beer of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mathis ordered only twenty casks for the present, and
returned home with a long face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two days before St Rochus, three great Prussian freight-waggons,
laden with planks and battens and canvas, passed
through Haffert, and stopped at the Schei, right opposite the
“Sun” inn. A moment after, Crippled Manes was seen
hobbling up from another direction, with an old police-cap
on his head, and followed by a number of schoolboys and
loafers from the town, where the rumour of the arrival of
the “foreign dancing-tent” had already spread. A large
number of hands went to work at once; timbers were
unloaded, posts set up, canvas spread out; and in the middle
of all the bustle the lame recruiting-sergeant moved about
with his bottle of Hollands, encouraging the workmen,
and sometimes garnishing the offered glass with some such
facetious remark as, “To the health of M. le Curé of
Haffert;” or, “To the health of Mathis Knoups, our
neighbour!”</p>

<p class='c009'>However, Mathis Knoups, who, with compressed lips,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>stood on the watch behind the door of his workshop,
could not hear what he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all this was nothing to the commotion which was
caused on the following day—the Eve of St Rochus—in
Haffert and on the Schei, by the arrival of twelve Prussian
musicians, in faded light-green coats, sky-blue caps, and
all sorts of brass instruments,—one or two of them of
such a size that they curled all round the blower like serpents.
They marched through Haffert playing all the way,
drew up in a line before the dancing-tent, which was decked
with flags and pennons, and then entered the town, accompanied
by Crippled Manes, who now, armed with a big stick,
marched in front, and acted the part of drum-major.</p>

<p class='c009'>All through the night Mathis could still hear the shrill
sound of the clarionet and the booming of the great bass
instruments.</p>

<p class='c009'>No need to ask whether Haffert <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kermis</span></i> was crowded!
Everybody went to dance in the Prussian tent. The brewer
had to go over twice a day with fresh supplies; and when
Knoups came to complain to him, on the third day, that he
had only tapped eight casks, it was resolved to cart eight
casks away from the “Sun” to the tent over the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” laughed Manes, “neighbours ought to help
each other!”</p>

<p class='c009'>When, two days later, the three heavily-laden waggons
had rumbled off over the Prussian frontier, and Stammering
Joob and Crippled Manes were marching away to the town,
arm in arm, and not very sober, the latter turned back and
shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, Master Knoups! next year we’ll be neighbours
again, for a time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Low riff-raff, that come to steal the bread out of a man’s
mouth!” said Knoups—who had heard it this time—to
Geutruu. “Well, <em>that</em> article’s spoilt for good and all; I shall
have to put all my strength into my own trade!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The following week, a notice, posted up on the Haffert
Raadhuis, announced to all and sundry that tenders for the
new roofing of the church were to be sent in to the authorities
by that day fortnight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s no good <em>my</em> sending in a paper,” thought Mathis;
“the Curé and the burgomaster are all in the same boat,
and the Curé will take good care I don’t get the contract.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be supposed, therefore, that he looked amazed
when Geutruu, returning from the town one rainy afternoon,
stood still, right in front of him, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I’m going to tell you something! You’ll have
to send in your paper for the church roof!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I!—for the roof!” cried Mathis.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You, for the roof!” repeated Geutruu. “Just listen
now. I had just got outside the gate when it began to rain.
I was going to turn my skirt up over my head, when somebody
came running after me, and called out, ‘Vrouw
Knoups! Vrouw Knoups!’ I turned round, and who should
it be but M. le Curé’s sister, Joffer Marianneke. ‘Come
along under my umbrella,’ says she, ‘and I’ll walk home with
you!’ I said, ‘Too much honour, Joffer Marianneke,’ and
‘Thank you, Joffer Marianneke,’—but it was no use, I had
to come along under her umbrella. And then she told me
that M. le Curé quite expects you to send in your paper for
the contract, and that it grieves him so much that there should
be a black sheep in the congregation; and she is coming
next week to drink coffee with us. And what do you say
now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups listened, astonished, and at the same time
excited.</p>

<p class='c009'>“H’m!” he said then, “... we must just think over
that&nbsp;... one ought to know what one is about!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a very busy day for Geutruu, when Mam’selle
Marianne, the Curé’s sister, came to coffee. She had baked
special cakes—<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vlaai</span></i> and <em>krintemik</em>; and, when her guest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>had arrived, she went herself to fetch Mathis out of his
workshop. Mathis laid aside his apron, wiped his forehead
with it, and followed his wife indoors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Serviteur</span></i>, Joffer Marianneke,” said he, accomplishing
with some difficulty an awkward kind of bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve just looked in to see how you are getting on,
Master Knoups,” said the Curé’s sister, taking a bite at her
slice of currant-loaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very kind, I’m sure, Joffer Marianneke! and I wish you
a good appetite!” replied Knoups.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow M. le Curé is going round with the alms-bag,
Master Knoups, for the new roof to the church. Are
you going to give something too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“H’m, h’m! If M. le Curé does not pass my door, we’ll
see what we shall do, Joffer Marianneke!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day came M. le Curé with the alms-bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Knoups, I am going to <em>all</em> our parishioners.”
He emphasised the “all.” “Will you contribute something
towards the new roof for the church?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now that Knoups was standing before his enemy, it
seemed as though something boiled up in him,—as though
he would have to say something quite different from what
he had thought out beforehand,—and yet there was such a
tightness at his throat that he could not bring out a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>He kept his eyes fixed on the priest, made one or two
great efforts to swallow the lump in his throat, and at length
burst out, clinching his fist convulsively:</p>

<p class='c009'>“M. le Curé, why did you revenge yourself on my child
for the grudge you had against me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And at the last words he struck his clinched hand against
his chest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chut! chut!</span></i> Master Knoups,” said the Curé, with a
deprecating wave of the hand; “I have duties to fulfil,—and,
after all, you had been warned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had said publicly, in the pulpit, Master Knoups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>is a heretic,—if you had turned me out of your church,
some Sunday, in the middle of high mass, I could forgive
it; but&nbsp;... my child....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come, Knoups, don’t go dragging drowned cows
out of the ditch,—think of the new church roof. You’re a
carpenter, and if I meant ill towards you I would not have
come to you with the alms-bag.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These words soothed Knoups somewhat. He silently
offered the Curé a chair, and sat down opposite him. Then
he put his hand under his blue blouse into his jacket
pocket, took out a paper, unfolded it, and laid it before the
priest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“M. le Curé,” he said, “here is my tender for the contract
If the work is given to me, I will deduct twenty
gulden from the sum, as my contribution to the roof.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then, Knoups, and then?” asked the Curé, in a
tone of serious admonition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you mean, M. le Curé?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to have the dancing again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“M. le Curé,” answered Knoups, “I am quite willing to
live in peace and friendship with every one; but I ought to
be allowed to earn a few stivers when I want them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you think, Knoups, that this dancing business
is all profit? Do you know that people of position are shy
of your house for that very reason? Why do the professors
from St Aloysius’ College, and all their students,—and the
Christian Brothers, and all their schoolboys—why do they
always pass the ‘Sun’ by? You have a good head for
reckoning, I’ve often heard, Master Knoups. Did you ever
figure out what it would come to in a year if two hundred
young fellows were to come every week, or say every fortnight,
to have a glass of beer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups’ whole face shone with excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, one could lay out a skittle-ground with that!” he
cried.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Well, are you going to repent of your ways, and come
to church again, Knoups?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you give me absolution if I did?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had no more dancing—why, there would be no
further reason for refusing it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups sat still, and thought for a little. Then he took his
broad carpenter’s pencil, wrote on the paper, “<em>less twenty
gulden for the roof</em>,” and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll see, M. le Curé, we’ll see. And, after all, I’m not
the worst.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The same evening, in the “Sun,” Hommels was talking
about the elections.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pooh!” cried he, “convictions! I hate the sound of
the word. Money is all they care about, or the honour of
sitting in the council and having their say in everything!...
There you have the burgomaster Driemans; he has
been liberal three times, and clerical three times, and every
time he got in!... and the <em>rentier</em>, Lankmans, formerly
president of a dramatic society, who ate meat on Fridays,
chosen as a defender of the Faith!... and our deputy,
Judge Stechelmans, who formerly, when he was a school
inspector, cursed and swore when he found a crucifix hanging
in a school, he too is a pillar of the Church! And the
priests know all that very well, but what do they care? such
men are of use to them, and that’s enough!... <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sufficit</span></i>, you
know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, so,” said Knoups, in a naïvely satirical tone, half
shutting his eyes, “is that what they mean by politics,—a
question of money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knoups sent in his tender for the contract for the new
church roof. There was indeed an offer made at a lower
figure by a builder in the town, but the Curé and the burgomaster
said that Knoups had the best timber on hand—even
though it had been bought with the proceeds of the dancing,
as Knoups said—and gave the contract to him. Knoups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>turned his dancing-floor into a skittle-ground, went to confession
on All Saints’ Day, and got his absolution all right.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since that time Mathis Knoups has become a Catholic
again. Hommels does not frequent the “Sun” now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One can’t put one’s foot down there without tumbling
over a professor from the College, or one of the Christian
Brothers’ boys,” he said. And when he makes his appearance,
now and then, to tease Mathis, and asks, “How do
you feel now, Mathis, as a New Catholic?” Mathis answers:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you may laugh, Mynheer Hommels, but just wait
till you come to die—then you’ll be frightened too....
And one must look after one’s soul,—isn’t it so, Geutruu?”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE CANDIDATE.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is now full two years since Dominie Groshaus departed
this life. For forty years the worthy man had tended his
flock at Harder, without a thought of laying aside his staff,
and quite resolved to edify his congregation for another
ten years or so. But Death was not of the same opinion
as the deaf old gentleman. One fine morning he came
along, and gently took the staff out of the shepherd’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le roi est mort, vive le roi</span></i>,” now came true at Harder.
Scarcely had the grave closed over Dominie Groshaus,
when they began to think of choosing a new pastor. This
time it must be a liberal; that was plain as a pikestaff.
The Harder people wished to show that they could advance
with the times. But where to find him—that was the
question. The stipend was not large, and the number of
“advanced” candidates exceedingly small,—a bitter disappointment
for the Harder parishioners, for your farmer
knows no greater enjoyment than in listening to the trial
sermons of a “whole regiment” of candidates. As matters
stood, however, there was nothing for it but to cut their
coat according to their cloth, and six probationers were
accordingly invited to display their gifts. The Harder
people were not fortunate; for, behold, the last of the six
had already arrived, and been quartered at the schoolmaster’s,
and they had not yet found the right man! It will be
understood that they were waiting the last trial sermon in a
state of great excitement. No one’s heart, however, beat so
high as Mr Slop’s, for the last candidate pleased the schoolmaster
uncommonly well—yes, uncommonly. He had enjoyed
a most delightful evening in the young fellow’s
company. The conversation went as if on wheels. Tantalising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>prospectives of instructive conversations, profitable
exchange of thought—of society such as he had often vainly
longed for—opened themselves to the master’s mental
vision. Therefore it was his most ardent wish that this
candidate should succeed. He was just considering what
he could do to promote his success, when the probationer
suddenly put a question to him point-blank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you tell me, sir, the reason why my friend Burgers
did not give satisfaction here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! well—what can I say to you?—the man was the
victim of a stupid joke. His hair is, as I suppose you are
aware,...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Red—yes, fiery red,” sighed the probationer, with a faint
smile. “Yes—that hair of his!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” pursued the schoolmaster, “on the day Mr
Burgers was preaching here, Jaap Stricker, a farmer, who is
known as the worst joker in the village, happened to be
sitting in the pew just behind the elders. When the young
man, who was certainly doing his best, rather raised his
voice at the end of his sermon, and at the same time threw
his arms out quickly, Jaap Stricker bent over to the burgomaster,
and whispered to him, ‘The fire is bursting out.’
That joke, sir, was the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il n’y a pire que le ridicule</span></i>,” thought the probationer,
“even among these farmers.” And suddenly—as the
schoolmaster drew the little stove towards him in order to
light his pipe—there rose up before him the image of Hein
Burgers, the rejected, as he used to sit at students’ gatherings,
with his honest, jovial face, crowned—alas! with locks
of too brilliant a colour. He saw once more the gloomy Van
Overveen pretending, with his melancholy smile, to light his
cigar at Hein Burgers’ flaming head; he heard one and the
other call out, on finding that his pipe had gone out, “Just
pass Hein this way, will you?”...</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was just saying,” the schoolmaster continued, carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>putting the cover on his pipe, after a vigorous pull or
two,—“I was saying that was the finishing touch. For even
if Mr Burgers’ hair had been black instead of red, the man’s
chance was gone. In the first place, he forgot, when he
entered the church, to salute the elders—ahem!—just nod
to them, you know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aha!” said the candidate, making a mental note of the
fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, besides that, there was something in his sermon
the burgomaster did not like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the schoolmaster’s lips opened, and the pipe slid
into the corner of his mouth. His eyes wandered over the
ceiling, while he exhibited that vibration of the diaphragm
which, according to Darwin, is the symptom of suppressed
mirth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pah!”&nbsp;... he continued, after a pause, emitting a
thick cloud of smoke, under shelter of which his face came
back into its normal condition. “You must know that
there occurred in his sermon an allusion to Galileo. This
was what offended the burgomaster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Galileo!” exclaimed the probationer, springing from his
seat. “Galileo! what earthly objection can the burgomaster
have to Galileo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much more than you think,” returned Mr Slop, with a
solemn countenance, but laughter in his eyes. “Much
more than you can conjecture. Our burgomaster has, along
with many good qualities, a weakness—a prejudice—what
shall I call it? The fact is, that he does not believe that
the earth turns round....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The shout of laughter emitted by his hearer reduced the
schoolmaster to silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two men looked at each other. The master laughed
too—the probationer’s mirth was infectious—but not so loud.
And while the young man continued to give free rein to his
emotions, Slop quietly groaned to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“Could a man have done a more unlucky thing?” he
went on at last. “Why need he have dragged in Galileo
at all? As soon as I heard the name, I thought to myself,
‘There goes your chance, my dear young gentleman!’ And
if he had confined himself to mentioning the name, no harm
would have been done; but he did worse—he called Galileo’s
opponents narrow-minded people! And at last, as if to
complete the disaster, he uttered it as his settled conviction
that there was no one among his hearers who believed in
the stability of the earth. Then I could see that it was all
up with him, for the burgomaster flushed up, red as fire.
Moreover, he nodded twice, and looked at the preacher
with angry defiance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop, sir! stop!” cried the candidate, holding his sides.
“But surely, then, your burgomaster—what’s the man’s
name?—Gorter—surely this Gorter is an original of the first
water?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is indeed. Let us only hope that Galileo has not
brought the whole modern movement into discredit with
him. I sadly fear that such is the case. At any rate, sir,
you are warned. If he enters on the subject to-morrow—as
he is almost certain to do—keep a good look-out, and mind
you don’t fall into the snare.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the following morning the church was as full as it
could hold. The candidate gave particular satisfaction.
His delivery was more than satisfactory; his voice was as
clear as a bell. Such was the verdict of the parishioners.
Very well content, and with a great air of mystery, the
elders received the preacher at the end of the service. For
when the farmer has once made his choice, he takes good
care not to give the slightest hint of it—sly diplomat that he
is! The candidate was to dine at Burgomaster Gorter’s.
Aaltje, the good-natured, bashful, kindly wife of that dignitary,
had prepared ribs of pork. With heartfelt satisfaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>did the couple take note of the young man’s hearty appetite.
He did not require any pressing, and played as good
a knife and fork as if he had been at home. This pleased
the burgomaster well. A good appetite is usually the sign
of good health. Who would buy an unhealthy cow? And
what person in his senses would wish to possess an unhealthy
minister?</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the repast, a walk in the orchard was proposed.
The burgomaster, pipe in mouth, stumped along in
his wooden shoes, solemn and dignified—a sphinx in a
peaked cap—beside his guest, and took him to see the pigs.
Then they slowly returned to the house, the farmer still preserving
an air of tremendous mystery.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last Mijnheer Gorter broke the ominous silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was very well-pleased with your discourse this morning,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you, sir? I’m glad to hear that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They want a modern man in this place. Well—I’m
modern, too!” The burgomaster’s chin moved backwards
into his black silk neckcloth, while a smile of grim self-satisfaction
played about his lips. “I’m modern, and progressive
too,” he went on. “But there is one thing I can’t
get over. I don’t believe that the earth turns round. No one
can make a fool of me about that. Every morning when
I go out into the fields, I see it with my own eyes lying

thought,—that turning round, I suppose,—has it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” replied the candidate, fairly driven into a corner,
“it certainly does have a little to do with it; but, after all, it’s
not the principal point. One may be a good and honest
and religious man, and yet be of opinion—I mean, believe—that
the earth stands still. St Paul, for example——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There you are!” roared the burgomaster, bringing his
hand vigorously down on his companion’s shoulder in the
fulness of his satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>the maid—behind the scenes</em>). Michiel, where are

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel</em> (<em>awaking</em>). Well, what’s up now?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Wake up, at any rate! Isn’t it perfectly scandalous
to lie there, at seven o’clock in the evening, snoring like an ox?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Does that hurt any one?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Is there no work to do then?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> That won’t amount to much. Travellers won’t
give us any trouble, it’s not worth their while to cross the
frontier just now; and the farmers have their money under
lock and key, and not a cent about them to take a dram
with.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Is there nothing else for you to do? Couldn’t you
take your rifle, in your spare time, and drill a little? Everybody
is drilling just now; there isn’t a child but can load at
twelve different rates. And you, of all others, ought to be
ready to give an account of yourself when the rebels come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>to pay us a visit. People on the frontier, if no others, ought

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Well! you’ve got hold of that sentiment by the

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Do you know that you deserve to be hanged, with
such infamous principles as that?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Why, it’s just to escape hanging that I want to put
them into practice, as our schoolmaster says.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Our schoolmaster used to say you were an
ignorant ass; but I see that at any rate you have remembered
something.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> He shall be sorry, one of these days, for having
spoken of me in that way. But, never mind that, I have a
good idea.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> A fine one, I expect!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Just listen. We cannot help it if one party or the
other wants to annex us; so we must try and keep friends
with both, and make each of them believe we are on their
side. Now, I’ve asked the house-painter for a couple of pots
of paint: there they are. You say I never carry anything
out; now you shall just see.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span><em>Maria.</em> Well—and then?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Why, you see, the Orange flag is still on the
church tower?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Yes; and if you dare to touch it, I’ll scratch your
eyes out!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> My idea was to paint it with the Brabant colours
on the side towards Brabant. If the Dutch come from
the north—very good! they see the Orange flag. If the
Brabanters come from the south—very good too! they’ll
see their own colours.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Well, that’s a nice invention!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Isn’t it? I think they ought to give me a prize
out of the village treasury; for in this way I am saving every
one from embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> But you’ve forgotten one thing!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Forgotten! What’s that?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> When the wind changes, the Brabanters will see
Orange, and the Dutch the Brabant colours; and then,
perhaps, both of them will bombard the village, and you in
it—which would not be the worst loss of all.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> That’s true; I never thought of that. But, after
all, is there no contrivance to prevent that? With a rope,
for instance?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> You’re a nice politician! It doesn’t do to forget
that the wind may change. So leave politics alone for the
future, or I’ll tell the master what sort of fellow you are.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Would you go and tell tales, just because I have
a little more sense than the master? He will get us all into
trouble before he’s done, because he can’t give and take.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Then both of you taken together ought to make a
man after your own heart. If you ask any of the poor people
hereabouts, they will tell you whether or not he knows how
to give; and if you were in his place, you would certainly do
nothing but take.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Yes; having is having, but getting’s the trick!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Much good has the master done himself, with all his giving
away. Then you have the King; what numbers of people
he has helped out of his own pocket-money! And what has
he gained by it? Nothing! They are breaking his window-panes
with his own three-guilder pieces!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Would you follow the example of such ungrateful
wretches?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Just now the question is, What pays best? And if
we are ever to be man and wife, it will surely be necessary
to scrape a little money together first, if we want to live like
decent people.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> We man and wife! You may make your mind
easy on that point!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> It’s not to be? Very good—you’ll change your
mind some day, and come asking me on your bare knees
to make you my wife,—some day when I’m a great lord,
just like the man with the whale,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> who is now a general
among the Brabanters.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> If being a fool and a scoundrel is enough to give
a man high rank among the rebels, you will have plenty of
chances; but I won’t talk to you any more.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Have you anything more to say? Because, if
not, I’ll go to sleep again.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Nothing but this, that for the present, not being a
general as yet, you might go to Peter Kluisken’s and fetch the
pig that the master has bought.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> A nice little job! To tramp all that way at this
time of night, and in the direction of the Belgian sentinels,
too. Well, just you look out; if I meet them, I bring them
here—upon my word I will.</p>
<div class='c012'>[<em>Exit.</em></div>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Good news, my girl. A division of our brave
North Netherlanders is marching this way; perhaps they
may even pass through this village.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> They may seek long enough, the ungrateful
hounds, before they find another ruler under whom they
will be as happy as they were under our good old King.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Any news besides, sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Do let me read in peace.... H’m! yes; they
are complaining of scarcity in all the Belgian towns.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Of course they are. They may hate the Dutch,
but they’ll find they can’t get on without Dutch money.
What other news is there?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> The Powers have resolved to keep to the non-intervention
system.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Non-intervention! what’s that? It must be a fine
thing whatever it is; every one is talking about it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Well, how can I best explain it? It means&nbsp;...
not to meddle with other people’s affairs. For instance, if
your neighbour comes and asks you to help him because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>his house is on fire, and you tell him to put it out himself, for
it’s no affair of yours,—that’s non-intervention. But listen&nbsp;... I hear the sound of horses’ hoofs. Who can it be?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>A voice outside.</em> Does the burgomaster live here?</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> I want to speak to the burgomaster. Does he
live here?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Just come in, Lieutenant. Come in, gentlemen,
I am very glad to see you. What will your honour take?
Maria, run to the cellar, there’s a good girl, and bring up a
bottle of the best.</p>
<div class='c012'>[<em>Exit Maria.</em></div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span><em>Edeling.</em> Not for me, thanks; I don’t want anything. My
time is short, and so are my orders.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> I won’t listen to a word before the gentlemen

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> I do not care for useless compliments. I am
commissioned to buy some cattle here, and bring them at
once to headquarters. How many head can you let me
have, and at what price, to be paid in cash at once?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> We will see. (<em>To Maria.</em>) Is Michiel back yet?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> He is only just gone out.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Then you will have to do the errand. Run at
once to Peter Slof and Cornelis de Ruyter, and ask them to
come here at once. I want to see them about a cattle
contract. Well, what are you dawdling for?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Because—because——[<em>Looks at the lancers.</em>]
I’m so glad! [<em>Runs out.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas</em> (<em>offering wine</em>). Come, just one glass!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> If you insist. (<em>Suspiciously.</em>) Are you not going
to drink too, Burgomaster? (<em>Drinks.</em>) What’s to pay?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Who’s talking about payment? Haven’t I even
a glass of wine to spare for our brave defenders?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Well, but you’re an innkeeper. Take these two
guilders and put them in your pocket, for it’s against orders
for us to get anything on credit.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> And I say I won’t have the money. I can be
obstinate enough, too, when I once begin. Take it, and
give it to the Government as a voluntary subscription on my
part. You don’t trust me, Lieutenant, and that grieves me
to the heart. I see I shall have to put on my Sunday coat;
perhaps that will give you more confidence. [<em>Fetches a coat,
with a medal on it, and puts it on. The lancers salute.</em>] Now,
do I look like a man who would betray you? I won that
at Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Forgive me for suspecting you; but so many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>your class, especially on the frontier, have turned out traitors,
that suspicion has become a disagreeable duty. What is the
general feeling in this village?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Not what it ought to be. I fear that, if the rebels
were to arrive, there are those, here and there, who would
join them. It seems as though people were struck with
blindness; they want change at any price. They have let
themselves be persuaded that they will have no taxes to pay
under the Brabant Government. That’s the worst of the
people here; they are stupid, they don’t reason.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> They don’t know any better, I suppose. Do you
think your friends will be here soon?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Presently, I hope. Your honour seems to be in
a hurry. Is it far to headquarters?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> A couple of hours. We are to march again at
daybreak to-morrow. I am sorry we are not going farther,
for I fear we shall not meet any of the enemy. I would
willingly have paid them a visit.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> You are very eager for fighting.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Particularly so; for, besides my wish to do my
duty by my king and country, I have a private account to
settle with the gentlemen from the south. They are keeping
my bride a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Your bride! I thought women, at least, would
have been respected.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Her father is a well-known soldier; when the
first disturbances broke out in the place where he was in
command, he gave orders to fire on the rebels. They never
forgave him, and when he had the misfortune to fall into
their hands they kept him in prison—his daughter refusing
to leave him.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Here come Peter Slof and Cornelis de Ruyter.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Very good! Shall we go to meet them, and
look at their beasts together?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span><em>Edeling.</em> Willingly. Thank you for doing the errand (<em>to

by. [<em>Gives her money, and exit with Nicolaas.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>alone</em>). A guilder! Well, I’ll keep that as a remembrance.
A nice man that lieutenant! One can see he
comes from Holland. But who are these strangers coming
in so timidly?</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> Can we get a night’s lodging here?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Please don’t take it ill of me, I must ask first
where your honour comes from? We can’t take any one in
for the night without first knowing who it is we are sheltering.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> I will answer your question to the Burgomaster.
Where does he live? and can I speak to him?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> He lives here. The Burgomaster and the landlord
are the same person. The master will be home directly.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Clara.</em> Will you please tell us what province we are in?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> In North Brabant, Mejuffrouw.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Clara.</em> Thank Heaven! then you are safe, father!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Safe! Then you are refugees?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> Clara!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Clara.</em> I was imprudent, father—forgive me. But I could
not control my joy at finding myself once more in our own
country, after all that we have gone through.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> I am not yet sure that we are safe here.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Clara.</em> If we had anything to fear here, I feel sure, from
this girl’s honest face, that she would not betray us.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> I betray you! I’d sooner die a thousand times
over. But come and sit down—you seem tired.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Clara.</em> It is true, we have been walking for a long time,
and I begin to feel it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> My dear child, what a difficult and anxious
journey you have exposed yourself to, to save your father.
(<em>To Maria.</em>) Yes, my good girl, I have been in prison,—my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>daughter has succeeded in saving me, and it is to her
courage and devotion I owe it that we have been able to
pass the enemy’s outposts and reach this village.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> It’s lucky you just happened to come to-day. A
few Dutch soldiers arrived not long ago, who will be quite
ready to escort you to a safe place, if you prefer not to stay
here any longer.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> My comrades! Oh, where are they? Take
me to them.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> I will call them,—or—wait—I think I hear them
coming.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> They have gone on with the oxen. I found I had
left my cloak here. But whom do I see?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> The voice seems familiar.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Clara</em> (<em>hastens to him</em>). Edeling!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Clara!—Mijnheer van Werve!...</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> So you’ve enlisted, Edeling? Well done, my
boy! That is what I should have expected of a true-born
Dutchman like yourself!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Your words remind me that I am no longer my
own master. I am expected every minute at the camp.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Clara.</em> Cannot we go with you?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> I have only my horse; but perhaps there is a
conveyance of some sort to be had in the village.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Oh! three if you like. I will go at once to order
one.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> Stop a moment, girl. I—alas!—I have no
money to pay for a conveyance.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Here is my purse—but I really must go.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve</em> (<em>putting back the purse</em>). I must not accept it.
I can never return it. I possess nothing now.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Nothing?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> Not a cent. The little ready money we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>with us we have been obliged to spend on the road; and this
morning I had the misfortune, to leave behind——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> Well?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> My portmanteau, with my whole fortune in
it, at the village where we stopped for the night.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Well, portmanteau or no portmanteau, you will
have to drive, and I’m going to fetch the carriage.</p>
<div class='c012'>[<em>Exit.</em></div>

<p class='c009'><em>Van Werve.</em> It was no carelessness on our part; the
pursuers were at our heels—we had no time to save anything
but ourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling.</em> And isn’t it enough for me to see you safe, sir,
you and my Clara? Is not everything I have yours? Take
my purse. As soon as you can get a vehicle, follow me as
quickly as you can, for I must not delay one moment longer.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Well—now let us just look at it. H’m
that’s written very cleverly. Now for the proclamation.
Another sheet of paper! Write: Proclamation! Have you
written that sentence?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Yes—what next?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> We, Captain d’Eglantiers and Lieutenant
Taelinck,—to all who are about to read these presents—salutation!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span><em>Maria</em> (<em>writing</em>). To all who are <em>able</em> to read these
presents....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> <em>About</em> to read, I said! Fellow-citizens! we
are bringing you <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la liberté</span></i>. We have risked our life-blood
to procure it for you: we also hope that you will show yourselves
<em>reconnaissants.</em>... Hey! now what do you say to
such a sentence as that? That’s what I call eloquence!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Undoubtedly! That is very neatly said, Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> I see you’re a girl of taste and intelligence.
Go on—and that you are to give us&nbsp;... give us&nbsp;...
everything that is necessary. Well, that’s short and to the
point, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> A very fine style, and any one can understand
what is meant at the very first reading.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers</em> (<em>gratified</em>). Can’t they just?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Now you’re going to sign both papers, aren’t you,
Captain?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Yes; I’ll put a little cross to them—that’s
my mark. Lieutenant Taelinck, are you going to sign them
too?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck</em> (<em>half asleep</em>). Yes, yes. [<em>They sign.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Now the report must be enclosed in an
envelope, and sent to the General, and the proclamation will
be posted up to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Maria hastily hides the signed paper in her dress, and
folds another, which she hands to D’Eglantiers.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Here you are, Captain. (<em>Aside.</em>) I have it all
right.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers</em> (<em>hands the paper to Private Passereau</em>). Get
on your horse at once, and take this paper to the General.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Passereau.</em> <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verdikke!</span> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dans la nuit</span></i>——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Go at once! [<em>Exit Passereau.</em>] Well, that’s
finished. Now I’ll go and get an hour or two’s sleep. You’ll
call me, my good girl, when the council is assembled, won’t
you?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span><em>Maria.</em> Yes; and in the meantime I will go and post up
the proclamation.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers</em> (<em>takes it hastily from her, and puts it into his
pocket</em>). No; I must first read it out, or have it read, to the
council. Now, where is my bedroom?</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>He is about to go into Van Werve’s room.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>quickly</em>). No, not there. The left-hand door, sir.</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Points to a door on the opposite side.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas</em> (<em>aside</em>). I don’t understand it. Why does she
want to put that fellow into my bedroom? (<em>Aloud.</em>) Maria,
are you mad! the other room is——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>interrupting him quickly</em>). Just suited to a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers</em> (<em>pointing to Nicolaas</em>). Then he must be put
in there.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> But——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>quickly, aside to Nicolaas</em>). Leave it to me!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Good-night! (<em>Turning to the Volunteers.</em>) If
Nestiers comes with the portmanteau, tell him to bring it
into my room. Do you hear?</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Nicolaas goes into the room in which Van Werve and
Clara are hidden, while Maria takes a candle and
shows D’Eglantiers into the left-hand bedroom.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck</em> (<em>crouching over the fire</em>). B-rrr! it’s famously cold!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> I believe you! The Government really ought to
provide us with better clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> That’s just the beauty of liberty, that every one
has to look out for himself.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> And that’s just what I mean to do, so soon as that
girl comes back.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Edeling</em> (<em>appears in the doorway and looks in</em>). These fellows
are everywhere! I am caught in a trap.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> But just tell us now, Lieutenant, who is supposed
to be governing us at the present moment? for every day I
hear of a fresh sovereign, who has been recommended to us.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> Who is governing us? Why, Liberty!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span><em>Pluckx.</em> I shan’t be sorry to see some change, then; for I
haven’t yet seen the colour of Liberty’s money. I think the
lass must be very hard up.</p>

    <div><em>Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Maria</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>aside</em>). Is this rabble going to stay here all right?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> I say, my girl, look here. Have you got a
blanket or rug you could let me have?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> What for?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> You’ll soon see that—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comprenez</span></i>?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> I have; if you will be sure to give it back.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> Oh! you shall have it back soon.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>takes a blanket out of a chest</em>). Here is one; but
you shall not have it, unless you give me your tunic as a
pledge that you will return it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> Come, none of that chatter!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Gently, gently! You have seen that the Captain
lets me write his proclamations for him. Nothing would be
easier than for me to put in a word against you, if you don’t
behave yourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> The girl is right, Pluckx.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> Well, here’s my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sarrau</span></i>, then! It’s not a bad
exchange. [<em>He gives his tunic to Maria, and cuts three slits
in the blanket.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> What’s that for?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> A new-fashioned overcoat for the winter. [<em>Puts
his head and arms through the slits. All laugh except Maria.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Well, as you’ve spoilt my blanket for me, you shall
not have your tunic back either.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Nestiers</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Nestiers.</em> Come, men, here are your billets; and here
(<em>laying it on the floor</em>) is the Captain’s portmanteau.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> You mean the portmanteau that the Captain
looted this morning.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span><em>Maria and Edeling</em> (<em>aside</em>). Is it possible?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> Well, be quick and give out your billets. I’m
going to stay here. I suppose there’s a second bed in the
Captain’s room?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Surely.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons donc!</span></i> Right-about march! Place a
sentry outside the front door, and see that no one goes in
or out without permission from the Captain or me.</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Goes into D’Eglantiers’ room with the portmanteau.
The others retire. Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Edeling</span>, <em>to whom Maria
hands Passereau’s tunic, in which he escapes</em>.]</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Act II.</span></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Middle of night.</em> <span class='sc'>D’Eglantiers</span> <em>alone with the portmanteau
under his arm and a candlestick in his hand</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> I see they’ve brought me the portmanteau.
Let’s seize the golden moment, while old Taelinck lies snoring
like an ox, to inspect the contents a bit. [<em>Breaks the lock, and
rummages through the portmanteau, taking out a necktie or
some similar article, which he puts on.</em>] What do I see?
This seems to be a handsome capture! And I’ll be hanged
if these are not Government bonds! <em>Ma foi!</em> Now I’m a
rich man, and can let the service slide with an easy mind!
I shall lose nothing by resigning—no one ever got his pay
out of a Provisional Government! However, we must keep
a sharp look-out, and not let any of my comrades find out
what has been in here! All honest fellows, no doubt, but
suffering from the same complaint as myself! Where shall I
hide the packets? The portmanteau won’t lock now; and,
besides, several of them have seen it already.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>[<em>Remains standings with the bonds in his hands. Enter</em>
<span class='sc'>Maria</span>.]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Up already, Captain?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers</em> (<em>starts, and tries to hide the papers</em>). What,—what
is it?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>aside</em>). That’s the portmanteau in question. (<em>Aloud.</em>)
Nothing, Captain; I came to see if you wanted anything.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Nothing! or,—wait! (<em>Looking at her
attentively. Aside.</em>) The girl seems trustworthy&nbsp;... otherwise&nbsp;... yes, I suppose that will be best!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>aside</em>). What is he considering with himself?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> My good girl, I have here some of the army
reports; could you tell me of a safe place, where no one comes
poking and prying round, and where I can <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cacher</span></i> them in
safety till my departure?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>aside</em>). He’s running into the trap of his own
accord. (<em>To D’Eglantiers, pointing to the cupboard.</em>) Shall
I hide them in here, under the house linen? But in that case
you must give your men orders not to go about plundering
my cupboards.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> I’ll promise you that, but just open it.</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Maria opens the cupboard; D’Eglantiers hides the
bonds inside it.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> I think, Captain, that packet must contain something
more than reports and general orders!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> No, it really does not, by——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Well, I’ll believe you; so you need not swear about
it. But it looked to me rather like bonds. [<em>Locks the cupboard,
and is about to put the key in her pocket, but
D’Eglantiers prevents her.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Stop! I keep that key, do you hear?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Do you, sir? they’re bonds! Otherwise you would
not be so much afraid of losing them!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Yes, if that were true——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Then you wouldn’t be captain of a volunteer
company, would you?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> No, certainly not!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> No, if you were only rich, you’d already be a
Member of Congress,—perhaps even of the Provisional
Government....</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Yes; I do really think, if I were richer——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Not a doubt about it! A man of your talents and
your eloquence would certainly have reached a high rank
at Brussels, but for the want of means.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> You’re flattering me; but, after all, think
of the numbers of conceited fools that have been elected
to Congress! They do nothing but talk and mismanage
matters.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> I really think that you ought to be there, sir. It’s
quite a mistake your not going! Brussels is the only place
fit for you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> I tell you once more, you’re a flatterer; but
I promise you one thing,—as soon as I’ve hoisted the Brabant
flag on the church tower of this village, I’ll go to Brussels
and ask for my discharge.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria</em> (<em>aside</em>). A pleasant journey to you,—so long as the
bonds remain here!</p>

    <div><em>Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Taelinck</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> You’re up early, Captain?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Yes, yes, good-morning! (<em>Looking sideways
at the portmanteau.</em>) May the devil——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> It seems to me you’ve been looking out for yourself
already. Was the portmanteau quite empty like that?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers</em> (<em>somewhat embarrassed</em>). Well, there wasn’t
much in it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> You’re not a man of your word, Captain! You
promised that we should share and share alike, whatever
was in it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> When there is nothing, there’s nothing to
share; do you hear?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span><em>Taelinck.</em> You might at least have waited to open it till
I was there.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Lieutenant, you’re becoming insolent; you’re
forgetting discipline!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> I shall let the General know that you keep all
the loot to yourself.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> There stands the girl,—ask; let her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">témoigner</span></i>
whether there was anything in it but——</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> But eight linen shirts, which the Captain gave me
to put away in the cupboard. Shall I get them out,
Captain?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Yes, yes,—here’s the key! (<em>Aside.</em>) That’s
a little jewel of a girl!</p>

<p class='c017'>[<em>Maria opens the cupboard, and takes out a pile of shirts,
which she drops on the floor. While the two officers
are busy picking them up, she hides the bonds under
her apron.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> There they are,—eight of them!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> That’s five for me,—but was there nothing
more?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Nothing. [<em>She locks the cupboard, and returns the
key to D’Eglantiers.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers</em> (<em>aside to Maria</em>). If I ever get into the
Government, I’ll see that you have a pension.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> I should like to ask you something, sir. First,
about the landlord,—my master, you know,—the man you
took prisoner yesterday, and who is in that room; will you
set him free again?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> H’m! h’m! a rebel like that? but, since
you ask it&nbsp;... well, go and fetch him!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> And in the second place, will you let my sister and
my uncle, who are sleeping here, go back to their own village
undisturbed?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Where do they live?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Maria.</em> Why&nbsp;... not very far off.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Well, if they lived at the other end of

<p class='c009'><em>Pluckx.</em> Very good, Captain.</p>

once be placed in my hands, in order to clothe my valiant
troops.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> They can take care of themselves in that respect
(<em>Points at Pluckx.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> All the wine and provisions in the place
must be presented to my troops as a voluntary gift.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Anything else?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> All swords, guns, knives, spades, axes,
pickaxes, ploughshares—in short, all iron tools must be
handed over to me.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> He’s not hard to please, <em>he</em> isn’t.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> And the council is to deliberate whether
it would not be well to send in an address declaring their
submission to the Government.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> A very good idea.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> I should like to say a word.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Speak up!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Taelinck.</em> He can’t speak. He is only the ex-Burgomaster;
he is not entitled to a share in the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Never mind—let him speak as one not
entitled.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> If I may speak without danger, I should like to ask
what <em>is</em> the Government that we are to submit to? I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>already heard some half-dozen sovereigns mentioned; and
really I should not be surprised if you had offered the crown
to a Chinese mandarin.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> Tut! tut! all you’ve got to do is to submit—it
doesn’t matter to whom. That’s not your business.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Then I vote against such an absurdity.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>The Schoolmaster and others.</em> So do I! so do I!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> I shall put you under arrest if you don’t
vote as I tell you.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> Is that what you understand by liberty?</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> You are at liberty to talk as much as you
like, but you must vote as I wish.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Nicolaas.</em> I thought you were more liberal than that,
Captain!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>D’Eglantiers.</em> I can’t waste time arguing with you. [<em>Takes
the proclamation out of his pocket.</em>] Here’s my manifesto.
Let the Burgomaster read it out loud.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Michiel.</em> Silence! Let every one listen! (<em>Reads.</em>) “Proclamation,—We, Captain D’Eglantiers——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A glass of wine, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You, Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frederica?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hendriek doesn’t take any wine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! no, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And my Lijsje?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! it would be dreadful, papa!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mijnheer Van Arlen, having gone through this ceremony,
half-filled his glass, filled it up with water, and then carefully
corked the bottle, to be put away for to-morrow. In
this way it would be made to last ten days, and as a rule it
did so; for the above invitation to his wife and seven
daughters was renewed every day, and every day regularly
declined. However, there were some exceptions to this rule:
in the first place, when papa was on a journey. Every year
papa had to take a journey for the Minister; it was a mission
of mysterious importance, whose destination no one was to
know. It always came off quite unexpectedly, immediately
after the receipt of his second quarter’s salary. On these
occasions the bottle, if it still contained any wine, was
emptied by the family, and papa’s own particular tumbler—a
most precious one, of ruby glass, with a flower-pattern, and
the initials H. M. engraved on it—put away in the china-cupboard
for the space of ten days. For this unexpected,
mysterious, and important journey always lasted exactly ten
days, during which time the daughters enjoyed the mild joke
of calling their mother “Madame Veuve,” and were solemnly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>requested by her not to do it, for, as she said, it was a sort
of joke that always sent a cold shudder through her. She
preferred being called “little bride,” which took place once
a year, on her wedding-day, an occasion which formed the
second of the exceptions referred to above. On this occasion
papa always provided mamma with the surprise of a
glass of port at dinner, and all the seven daughters had some
too, though in their hearts they would have preferred not
taking it, for they detested it—and it always gave one such
a colour in the evening!</p>

<p class='c009'>The third exception—which was only half a one—occurred
when papa had a relation or a friend from out of town on a
visit, when mamma would take a glass; and then the bottle
had to be finished, for wine only turns flat if it is left
standing.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day, however, was merely an ordinary day. Papa had
received no instructions as to his journey, and the wedding
anniversary was some time off; though the friend from out
of town was expected, and might arrive any week. He was
something more than a friend—he was a late brother-in-law;
for Mevrouw Van Arlen—Hortense Muggenhout, as denoted
by the initials on the tumbler—had had a younger sister,
who had married Heer Van Noost Prigson, a most respectable
man, as appears from his double-barrelled name, which was
never forgotten, either by himself or the Van Arlen family.
Mijnheer Van Noost Prigson had lost his wife not long after
the birth of his only son.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Van Noost Prigson had written to-day he would
come; but he was a man of business,—of much business,—and
he wrote so quickly that three-fourths of each of his letters
were illegible. Fortunately, papa was also a man of business,
and in his responsible position was brought into contact
with so many matters—cipher, among others—that he
was able to read the writing of Uncle Van Noost Prigson,
at least the greater part of it. This time, however, the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>important part of uncle’s letter was in figures, and he always
made his figures very indistinctly. He said he might possibly
come on the 3rd (it might also have been the 8th),
unless it were the 10th—or (for the figures might equally
well have stood for that) the 21st—while at the end of the
letter he added, with equal distinctness, that it was to be
between the 14th and 16th, for which again one might have
read the 24th and 26th. Equally uncertain was the duration
of his visit; its purpose, indeed, was explained, and this
papa thought fit to keep to himself. It must surely be a
matter of importance, thought the eight ladies, for the
thought that he—with his vast experience of all sorts of
business—should have failed to decipher this part of the
letter never entered their heads for a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Papa filled a most important office,—it was in the year
1846,—and in consequence of one thing or another, perhaps
in connection with the mysterious journeys, he had, one 6th
of December, received a token that the State appreciated his
services. Since that day, the said token had been inseparable
from the black coat, without which no one ever saw Mijnheer
Van Arlen. It was quite in harmony with the impressive
wrinkle on his forehead, which looked as though Van Arlen
had for years been staring upward in a bent position,—in
harmony, too, with the compressed lips, which seemed in
continual fear of letting a State secret escape; while his hair
had become quite white, probably from the anxiety occasioned
by the weighty matters which occupied his head.
The daughters found in papa the type of a handsome man,
and at the same time of a thoroughly respectable one; mamma
adored him with the enthusiasm which every good housewife
is bound to feel for her husband, and never spoke of him
except as “Mijnheer Van Arlen.” Conversely, he always
referred to his wife as “<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mevrouw mijne echtgenoote</span></i>;”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>he preferred to allude to his daughters in numerical order,
unwilling to admit the outer world to so great a degree of
familiarity as to speak to it of his daughters by their
Christian names.</p>

<p class='c009'>Either the bottle had stood too long on this particular
day, or some other cause had spoilt Van Arlen’s taste for it;
anyhow, he did not finish his glass, and, when dinner was
over, fixed a penetrating gaze on the door, and remained
silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you not well, papa?” asked Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite well, my child!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Difficult business?” asked Mevrouw, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! all business is difficult, mamma,” said Van Arlen,
weightily, and stared into nothing more perseveringly than
ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamma sighed, and the daughters looked sadly at papa.
Could Uncle Van Noost Prigson’s letter be the cause of the
trouble?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you have any dessert, papa?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The dessert was standing ready, as usual, on the small
side-table. A box of flat biscuits, a butter-dish, a corner of
cheese under a glass cover, and a little dish of fruit, or, if
there was none to be had, of preserved ginger. But papa
did not care for dessert, and never took any, except when
the above-mentioned relation or intimate friend from the
country was present; for “a dinner is not complete without
dessert.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you, my dear? Will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you know I never do. Shall we say grace?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Grace was said, reverent and short, as is befitting in a
house where a good tone prevails, and papa folded up his
napkin neatly, and laid it beside his plate; whereupon Leida
fetched the matches, and gave papa a light, which he
accepted with a gracious nod, just as he had done yesterday,
and the day before, and all the year round, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>exceptions aforesaid. Then eighteen-year-old Leida gave
her papa a light kiss on his forehead, just above the broad
wrinkle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, papa! you must not be so gloomy; just let me
kiss the trouble away,” said she.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What tricks next?” asked papa, sportively; and mamma
called her a monkey, and all the six sisters thought it such
a good thing that Leida was in such spirits, and had such a
knack of getting papa into a cheerful humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen lit his cigar, and went slowly and thoughtfully
to his own room, whither he was called by his weighty
official cares, and where a mysterious locked portfolio lay
ready for him. He turned the key in the lock, sat down in
his easy-chair, and went to sleep. He was quite right to
lock himself in,—a State secret might so easily have escaped
him in his sleep,—nay more, the secret of his after-dinner
nap, which was entirely unknown to his household and the
outer world, might have leaked out. About half-past seven
there was a modest knock at the door; the person knocking
waited patiently till all the State secrets should be
covered up; and when the door was opened, the table
before Van Arlen was strewn with papers. The inkstand,
however, remained on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she who entered the room suspected no deception,
and was not on the look-out for traces of it. Year after
year it had been Mevrouw Van Arlen’s habit to bring her
husband his “first cup” at this hour, and the ten minutes
which he was accustomed to give her served for the discussion
of domestic matters. Papa listened attentively to what
mamma had spent on milk and on bread, on peas and
beans and matches,—nothing is too small for a great man,—and
then handed out the exact amount from the secret
drawer of his writing-table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then, papa, Caroline and Frederica and Marie
ought to have new hats.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“And the three others?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They can have the old hats of the three eldest done up
with new trimmings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what becomes of <em>their</em> old ones?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They can use them for every day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen tried to form in his own mind a visible picture
of the change; but his habit of considering affairs of State
somewhat dimmed and confused his sight in matters of
everyday life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not rightly understand you, my dear. It seems to
me that the three eldest might just as well have the hats of
the next three, as the next three have the hats of the elder
ones passed on to them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caroline, Frederica, and Marie are the eldest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that a reason, mamma? Let us take, as our fundamental
principle, impartiality. Let us act without respect of
persons—it is a wise rule, a guarantee for the stability both
of a government and a household. Let us give no occasion
for jealousy by measuring with two different measures.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, papa——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Believe me, my dear, parents who show partiality are
sowing the seeds of unfriendly feeling, discord, hatred. Let
us be wise, and not bow to any antiquated principle of
primogeniture. What human experience has found to be
fatal in society, must not be introduced into our smaller circle
by us, the individual units of society.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But in that case they might as well all keep their own
hats, and trim them up afresh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let it be so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How mamma was to settle matters with her daughters was
her business; the head of the family was concerned solely
with the legislative, not with the executive department.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Leida must keep her old hat because she has
been so untidy; but she will have to have a new ribbon
on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Van Arlen nodded assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>They must have been great men who first preached impartiality,
and abolished the right of primogeniture. Here,
in this individual instance, was a saving of three new hats,—what
economy would be effected by the application of the
system to a whole State!</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you yourself, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been thinking of keeping on the mourning
for another year. My black dresses are all quite good
still.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we were so fond of poor Cornelia! When the
mourning is worn out the dead are forgotten, people say.
We must show that it is not the case with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or that we have been careful of our clothes,” Van Arlen
might have added; but though this inference did not enter
his head, another did.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So we shall not go out this year?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry, for the girls’ sakes; but it really is a duty.
But, all the same, we must not keep them quite shut up
either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mijnheer and Mevrouw Van Arlen were silent for a
little.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must not keep them shut up,” repeated the mother,
thoughtfully. “Do you think it possible you might some
time be transferred, Van Arlen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Hortense! don’t ask such questions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not out of curiosity, but in the interest of our
family. You are in such favourable relations with people in
high positions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think is the cause of this, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, your knowledge, your ability, your great——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think that a man possessing such qualities—mind
I don’t say I possess them—has much chance of being
sent away to a distance?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“No, but—it is hard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may be hard,—but when a man is indispensable—I
don’t say that I am indispensable—he has to put up with it.
The feeling that he is doing his duty conscientiously to the
State, ought to have most weight with him,—and it certainly
makes things easier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen finished his tea, and handed the empty cup to
his wife—the usual sign that the audience was over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Another cup?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, please—but no sugar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This condition was as stereotyped as the dessert; papa
only took one cup with sugar; the ladies did not care for
sugar, except at evening parties, when they took it to prevent
mistakes and confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen then went to work,—read, signed documents,
made a note here, and drew his pen through a sentence
there,—and became so absorbed in his work that he never
heard Marie come in on tiptoe, to set down the humble
domestic cup of tea on the table covered with State documents.
At the stroke of half-past nine Van Arlen rose, and
once more made his appearance in the family sitting-room,
where an old-fashioned card-table had been set out. After
working all day, he found that his mind needed some
relaxation. His wife and two of the daughters,—who took
turns in this, as in other things, were already seated; the
cards were dealt, and he had only to begin. They were
playing whist for recreation, and not for money—therefore
no reckoning was necessary; but the marking was done with
laudable accuracy, and every mistake was severely reproved—for
the furthering of every one’s enjoyment; for enjoyment
without seriousness does not deserve the name.</p>

<p class='c009'>Papa never spoke a word except what was required by the
game, and did not like any talking to go on in the room;
so that the five daughters who were not playing, sat silent
round the big table, each with her needlework, thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>about the hats they were not to have, the mourning that
their mother was to go on wearing, the ball to which they
were not invited, the opera they never went to, the new
fashions other people were going to wear, the novel they
were in the middle of, but which must not be read aloud
now papa was in the room, the riches they missed, the
enjoyment they did not know, the past that was so poor,
and the future that did not promise to be richer.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a ring at the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the ladies looked up; even papa laid down the cards
he was just about to deal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brother Van Noost Prigson!” said Mevrouw, in a tone
of some anxiety,—as well she might, for there was no meat
in the larder—in fact, nothing in the house but a small
angle of cheese, and a few ounces of ginger from the uneaten
dessert.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen said nothing: he was never precipitate, and in
all circumstances of life preserved his presence of mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a quiet little ring!” said Frederica.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could it be a message from the Minister, papa?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leen has not heard the bell—shall I ring?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mevrouw Van Arlen assented, and the sitting-room bell
was heard—a quicker and more excited ring than the heavy,
respectable front-door bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The bell rang, Leen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, I’m here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—the front-door bell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed it didn’t, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We all heard it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Impossible,” muttered the maid to herself, as she went to
see; “or else it must be some one who pulled the bell and
ran away—and you can’t be always on the look-out for that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All listened in strained expectation. The front door was
opened, but no sound of voices came from it; it was closed
again, and Leentje was heard shuffling off to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“She might come back and say who it was,” mamma
assented.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leentje was again sent for.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who rang the bell, Leentje?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as I thought, ma’am,—it was some boy that ran
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mijnheer Van Arlen was inwardly very indignant that his
family—among whom so good a tone prevailed—should
make such an exhibition of themselves in the presence of a
servant. Mamma blamed the girls’ curiosity, but could not
unconditionally accept the theory of the boy,—Leentje had
been too long at the front door for that. If it turned out that
she had been speaking to a “fellow” there, she would have to
leave next day. That sort of thing would not do in a
respectable house. The girls likewise declined to believe in
the boy—the bell had been rung too quietly. They wanted
to go out and look whether anything had been pushed under
the door. Then it struck Antoinette that the mysterious
ring might be connected with burglary, and this opinion
gave rise to some eager whispering, which caused papa to
turn a frowning brow, not once, but twice, in the direction of
the large table. In an unguarded moment Leida slipped
out into the passage, to institute an investigation <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in loco</span></i>, but
neither on nor under the door-mat was there any trace of a
paper. All conjectures remained fruitless.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the little street-boy, with the newly mended kettle on his
back, who, merrily whistling his favourite tune, had crossed
the quiet street, and pulled the bell, to give his aunt’s sister-in-law
a run from the kitchen for nothing,—if that small evil-doer
had known what a change and excitement he had caused
in a respectable family, insomuch that Van Arlen himself,
who filled such an important post, had laid aside for a
moment the business which occupied him, he would probably
have repeated the experiment on the following evening—if
only out of pity for the monotonous life of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>seven ladies, to whom even the pulling of the bell was an
event.</p>

<p class='c009'>The night has passed;—the little, sputtering, flickering
night-light, which burns in Van Arlen’s bedroom—for Van
Arlen does not believe in having no light in the house, one
never knows what may happen—has consumed all its oil
and gone out. The insolent sun, which has no pity for
faded carpets and curtains, has penetrated everywhere; and
if one could walk through the Van Arlens’ house at this hour,
when their high tone is still asleep, one would lose much of
the reverence inspired by the important position, the refined
manners, and the ceremonious intercourse with each other
of its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at this hour in the morning no one walks through
Van Arlen’s house except the maid, who, by the terms of her
engagement, is bound to “do” two rooms before breakfast.
This involves rising before five, though she does not go to
bed any earlier for that; she is also supposed to answer the
door, go out once in four weeks, “if it suits,”—and have
neither right nor claim to any extras beyond her wages, which
are moderate, and her perquisites, which are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nil</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>To be weighed against all this is the great advantage of
living with respectable people, and that is a great deal
in these days, Mevrouw says. Besides this, Leentje is
a “whole” orphan, and therefore ought to appreciate the
privilege of finding a home with such a family—though it is
true that Mevrouw Van Arlen will never engage a servant
with any parent or relative living, to save trouble with their
families.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Van Arlens are far too respectable to let us waste
any more time over their servant,—more especially as by
this time they are all assembled at breakfast, with the exception
of the head of the house, for persons who do much
brain-work need more rest than those who only tire their
bodies—so Mijnheer says. Mevrouw is seated before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>tea-tray—the daughters take cold water. Nothing is wholesomer
than cold water. Moreover, butter—at least, much
butter—is bad for the health. Bread in large quantities is
also unhealthy, and the ladies prove, by the extent of their
breakfast, that they quite subscribe to this opinion. The
“whole orphan,” also, is educated in the same doctrine, but
she is allowed to poison herself every morning with coffee—so
long as she does not exceed her two ounces a week.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know how it is, mamma, but that ringing the
bell last night does worry me,” said Frederica, by way of
morning reflection; and the other girls reflected also, and
talked it over, and objected, or supported each other, as if
there were really an interesting question at stake,—till papa’s
arrival restored silence. He cast one glance over the paper,
which no one was allowed to inspect before him, for fear
the news might evaporate, and then put it into his pocket,—for
girls have no business with newspapers, and his wife did
not care to see it. During the meal he spoke little—he was
oppressed by the prospect of all the important affairs awaiting
him; and he ate his bread and butter, and drank his
tea, with a solemnity which made it difficult to realise that
they were only ordinary bread and tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he rose. “Oh! papa! you scarcely give yourself
time for breakfast!” said his wife, and he did not dispute
the proposition. He kissed her and his daughters on
the forehead in silence, put on his hat, and went to his
office, thoughtful and abstracted, as if bowed down by the
weight of his position. He did not even see people who
bowed to him; as for miscellaneous human beings, they
were not worth his attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly some one stopped him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is lucky! I was just on my way to your house!”
cried this person in a loud voice,—so loud that all the bystanders
could hear Van Arlen being addressed like an
ordinary human being. “Have you been out to a funeral
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>A well-regulated smile hovered for a moment about the
official’s mouth,—“No, brother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You look just like it. How are they all at home?—your
youngsters growing up—eh? Nothing particular going
on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus talking, Brother Van Noost Prigson walked along
beside Van Arlen, and entered with him—no, actually preceded
him—into the door of the building where he exercised
his important functions. Preceded him! Van Arlen went
down five per cent. in the estimation of his subordinates
that day; and when his own messenger, with a low bow,
threw open the door of his private office, Van Noost Prigson
was again the first to tread the magnificent carpet, on which
inferior officials scarcely dared to set foot when expressly
summoned by their chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much to do—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the contrary, I am very busy to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well—reading and signing documents, and all that
sort of thing—I could do that too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall have to sign about three hundred and forty
separate papers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—I’d do that in half-an-hour; but if you really are
busy, I won’t keep you. I’ll come and dine with you to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good—and in that case, I’ll see——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t give yourself any trouble. I’ll call in and see
Hortense myself. You know you needn’t make any difference
in your ways for me, and I daresay you couldn’t very well
afford it either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen looked at his brother-in-law as if to ask, “Do
you mean to insult me,” but his expression changed as he
met the glance of the cheery but penetrating eyes. “Living
is dear at the Hague,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The more fool you, then, to stay here—and with seven
daughters, too! Just listen, Van Arlen,—I have a plan,
but I can’t carry it out without your help.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“Let me hear it before I promise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My plan is—to make Van Arlen rich.... Where did
you get that ridiculous thing?” he suddenly broke off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which?” asked the official—following Prigson’s eye,
which was directed to his breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—that bit of ribbon. I never heard of your getting
it. From Santa Claus, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you, Prigson; if you mean my
Order, I make it a point of honour to wear it, and I don’t
like its being made a joke of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A joke, my dear fellow? I have the most fervent
respect for all orders of knighthood—especially if they are
sent home on St Nicholas’ Eve.... Come in! Beg
pardon—I forgot this was <em>your</em> place. Can I stay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen glanced at the door,—it was only a clerk with
documents, and Prigson was suffered to remain while the
clerk waited and the official signed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the sort of thing that goes on all day long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—it seems to me you earn your money pretty easily.
But say, Van&nbsp;... I suppose no one can hear us talking
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,—it doesn’t matter to me, but I shouldn’t like it
on your account,—I want some money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen drew the palm of his hand across his forehead,
and stared at his brother-in-law without answering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so fearfully in debt that I don’t want to give the
alarm. I should be much obliged if you could let me have
those thousand florins I lent you. In a month or two you
can have them again, if you want; but I’ve got to live till
then, and I have nothing left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It comes at a very inconvenient time, Prigson.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear fellow, I would like nothing better than to give
you a receipt for the whole sum in full; for you’re a good
fellow, and have to struggle so hard, one ought not to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>it harder for you. But, just say now, when <em>would</em> it be
convenient?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen thought for some minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the beginning of next year,” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I could wait so long. I wish I could; but I have
an expensive undertaking on hand, which will perhaps by
next year put me in a position to accommodate you. But,
for the moment, I <em>must</em> have money; and I dare not try to
raise it myself for fear of ruining my credit, which I can’t
do without just now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in!” said Van Arlen, in answer to a knock at the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His Excellency would like to speak to you,” said the
clerk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So those fellows let themselves be called Excellency, do
they? I thought that was bad form now-a-days,” said Prigson,
loud enough to be heard by the clerk. But Van Arlen did
not reply, he was too thankful for the chance of escape from
his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you’ll be gone some time? An Excellency
like that has plenty of time for talking; <em>he</em> doesn’t work
himself to death,” said Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may be a couple of hours before I can get away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case I’ll say good-bye. By-the-by, is there any
place where I can see the papers? Are you a member of the
Besogne Club?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the White Club you’ll find all the daily papers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And will one of your cards be enough to admit me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t a card here, but——” Van Arlen looked
round, and his eye fell on the card of one of his subordinates.
“This will do just as well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci!</span></i>” said Prigson, with a just perceptible smile, and
left him.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Van Arlen returned from the Minister’s private
room, he sent to ask the functionary whose card he had given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>to Prigson to come to him, and, while waiting, wrote a note
to his wife, informing her of that gentleman’s arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the note had reached its destination, however, the
person in question had already appeared on the scene. He
had been shown into the <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">salon</span></i>, where, after sending up his
name, he paced up and down for about half-an-hour, vainly
seeking for diversion in the four framed engravings representing
the divisions of the day, typified by English ladies in the
large bonnets and short waists of a fashion forty years old.
The alabaster clock, with gilt ornaments, was not going—it
had not gone for twenty years,—and the vases were as
clumsy in form as monstrous in colouring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything dates from the year twenty,” muttered Prigson,
after a hasty glance at one article and another, “and these
things never break! The whole house and furniture is of
the year twenty—the girls too. Is none of them going to
appear? Hortense surely doesn’t require to make such a
toilette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pulled the bell. It had given no sound for the last
ten years;—but, as it happened, the maid was just passing
the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, my girl—you seem smart enough—just run
upstairs and tell your mistress I have only ten minutes to
spare, and I have to go out of town again directly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank Heaven!” thought Mevrouw, when the maid came
up with the message, “then he won’t stay to dinner!” and
in another moment she was downstairs, endeavouring, by
extra cordiality, to remove the impression which the long
waiting must have produced on Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry, brother, you can’t stay to dine with us in a
quiet way,” she said after a time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you really make a point of it, Hortense, I can alter
my plans to suit,” answered Prigson; “but you must not let
me put you out in any way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! not in the least; certainly not. You are always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>welcome, and our table is large enough. And what are you
doing just now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At this moment I am living on my means, for the last
enterprise came to nothing. But now I really have my eye
on something good. You must try and persuade Van Arlen
to take it up; it is certain to make him rich——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was interrupted by “Good-morning, uncle!” in three
different voices; and the three eldest Van Arlens proceeded
to welcome Prigson, who, in entire disregard of the tone of
the house, embraced them one after the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Always the same,” said their mother, smiling, and shaking
her finger at him, and the three girls blushed and sat down.
Then appeared the two next, to be welcomed in the same
way; and presently the two youngest turned up, to be likewise
honoured by their uncle. All seven were as neat as if
they had come out of bandboxes, and each had some fancy-work
in her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the subordinate official whose card Van Arlen had
given to Prigson appeared in the former’s room as desired,
he was received with—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mijnheer Talm, I have just taken the liberty of
using your name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do me a great honour, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of my relations, Herr Van Noost Prigson, from
London, wished to be introduced to the White Club, and
you know I can’t go there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mijnheer Van Arlen meant that his position was too
important to allow of his doing so. The official bowed—he
quite understood that.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I happened to have your card lying here, and I thought
you would be willing to do me that service.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, very much flattered. Can I be of any further
service to your relative? Take him about anywhere? But
I don’t speak English.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Oh, he speaks Dutch quite fluently,” replied Van Arlen;
“if one did not know it already, one would never guess that
he came from London. So it might be as well not to
mention it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mijnheer Talm was about to withdraw, with a low bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By-the-by, Mijnheer Talm, is Department Y in order?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought there was no hurry about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Minister has been asking me about it to-day, so I
should be glad to have it as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can promise to have it ready to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was work enough in Department Y to occupy Talm
all day and all the evening, perhaps half the night as well;
his meeting Uncle Prigson was scarcely possible under the
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>In any case, there was not much chance of this happening;
for when Prigson had left the Van Arlens’ house, with a
promise to return at dinner-time, he went straight to the
White Club, and got himself introduced by a Secretary of
Legation; and when Leida went to the confectioner’s to
double the stock of dessert-ginger, she saw Uncle Van Noost
Prigson sitting at the club window! Her heart beat high
with so much grandeur.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Talm’s conversation for the next six weeks consisted
principally of the English millionaire whom he had introduced
at the White Club at his chief’s request. He thought
it would do him no harm at the next chance of promotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>We left Van Arlen alone in his private room at the Government
office. There are moments in life when one prefers
not to be alone, yet has not the courage to break away
from solitude; moments when a seemingly impossible
resolution must be taken, when one would be thankful if—instead
of thinking and acting for one’s self—one could
blindly follow the dictates of another. All the weight of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>important position had never oppressed Van Arlen so much
as the idea suggested to him by his short interview with
Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>Imagine a man who, without knowing a note of music, is
handed the score of a symphony and told to read it. That
was about his state of mind with regard to the question Van
Noost Prigson had asked him. He had not a thousand
guilders in the world—not even a hundred.</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked up and down his room, staring at one thing
and another, but unable to forget that thousand guilders, and
the smallness of his salary. If he had a thousand—no, not
one, but ten, twenty, a hundred thousand—would he not be
a happy man? Then he would really live, as he now only
had the appearance of doing;—distinguished society, pretty
dresses for his wife and daughters, all pleasant things vainly
desired, would be his! Imagination has peculiar force in
such cases, and Van Arlen’s painted this ideal life for him
with rough but forcible touches, till he was once more
recalled to reality and the starting-point of his reverie—the
thousand guilders!</p>

<p class='c009'>Where was he to get them? He <em>must</em> have them. Sell
his possessions? The furniture was worth nothing. The
pictures?—who knew if the English engravings might not be
rare and valuable? He did not understand such things.
He had indeed pretended to some knowledge of art, but he
had none. If he had only the smallest grain! What would
a collector give him for them? Two hundred and fifty
guilders each? Surely they might be worth that. Perhaps
more—perhaps——</p>

<p class='c009'>Then arrived documents for signature, and Van Arlen
signed his name—signed again, and yet again, and imagined
that he was endorsing bank-notes. Why was his name not
of equal efficacy when written on a cheque? He could
always pay the amount later on; it was only for the time he
wanted it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Suddenly Van Arlen stood still. “Temporary—only
temporary—and if I pay it back, no one will ever ask after
it.” He opened a locked cash-box; it contained more than
enough to help him; it did not belong to him; it had only
been left in his care, to give account of when the sum was
complete. He stood up, and wiped his forehead, and once
more paced up and down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Who was going to inquire after it? The Minister? He
had other things to think of. His colleagues? The affair
did not concern them; they did not even know of its existence.
His inferiors? They would certainly mind their own
business; and if they did not,—after all, he was their chief,
and could give them what answer he thought fit. There it
lay. He opened the little parcel. Surely no one knew the
numbers!</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a knock at the door. Van Arlen started as if
he had committed a crime, yet kept looking at the money
that had been entrusted to him. It was in an unsteady
voice that he said, “Come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mijnheer Van Teuten would like to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Van Teuten?—I’m busy—well, one minute, then. Tell
him to come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man ushered into the private room wrote a magnificent
hand. For the moment that was nothing to the point—yet,
after all, it was something, for Van Teuten owed his career
to it—“the best hand in the department.” He did not
write quickly—that was beneath his dignity—but for really
beautiful writing no one could come near him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Teuten was visibly disturbed, as he stood facing Van
Arlen, who sat leaning over his desk. The cash-box was
shut.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr Van Teuten?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Van Arlen—I’m come—I hope you’ll excuse it.
I’ve come to make a request, on which my future depends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen looked up from his paper, and coughed importantly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>fixing his dark eyes on the chief clerk, as though
he suspected him of high treason.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know perhaps that—that I have absolutely no
means of my own, and, with the title of assistant secretary
(which I owe to my handwriting)”—here Van Teuten raised
his head with a certain pride—“in spite of my handwriting,
still only draw the salary of chief clerk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you want to be promoted, Mr Van Teuten?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Promoted—that is to say, sir—not exactly; but, Mr
Van Arlen, I can’t live! I’m poor, sir, and—if I write a
good hand—Heaven forbid, sir, that I should boast of it;
but, well, it is hard that one should have one’s merits, and
be forced to suffer from poverty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen gazed fixedly at the owner of the fine handwriting,
and asked him for a definite statement of what he
wanted—his time was valuable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do excuse me, sir; but I’m nervous—I’m agitated. I
shall have to pay my rent on Saturday—three-quarters’ rent,
sir,—and I’ve nothing—nothing—not so much as <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very sad for you, Mr Van Teuten, but you know that I
can be of no use to you in this matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, Mr Van Arlen, you can. I only want two hundred
guilders—nothing more, and then I am saved—saved! And,
you see, if I stood alone, sir, I shouldn’t care—I should find
some way out of it,—but I have a wife and five children. Oh,
God! Mr Van Arlen, it’s my last hope. Don’t let me go
like this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Teuten pulled out a red pocket-handkerchief, and
dried a few tears with it. Van Arlen stared at him, still lost
in thought, and forgot the man’s request in the comparison
he was drawing in his own mind, between this case and his
own. At last he asked slowly, “What do you want me to
do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lend me two hundred guilders, sir,—that’s all that I
hope, I entreat, I beg of you——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“Just listen to me, my good Van Teuten, and don’t get
excited,—tears are not becoming in a man of your age.
We’ve all got to work for our families, and some men in
this world happen to be better off than others—but that’s no
reason for giving way to passionate grief. As to your
request, it’s out of my power to grant it. Next time there is
any question of increase in salaries, I will do my best to
improve your position, but for the moment I cannot help
you. If I did, I should have all your colleagues asking me
for the same thing to-morrow, and my position will not allow
of my coming to the assistance of officials in this way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Teuten was searching his mind for a word—a sentence.
To-morrow, when he did not want them, he might think of
hundreds; now, he could find none that would add force to
his entreaty. He soon gave up the effort, and tried another
tack:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Minister is rich, sir,—don’t you think he might give
or lend me two hundred guilders?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen looked straight at him. True, the Minister
was rich, and what he refused Van Teuten he might yet be
induced to grant to Van Arlen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you would only speak for me, Mr Van Arlen,—I don’t
want to exalt myself—and yet, I believe—don’t take it ill of
me if I say so—I think my services are worth something—and
if His Excellency would be willing to give me the
money, I should be saved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably His Excellency would have the same reasons
for declining as myself; but I cannot conceive, Mr Van
Teuten, that there is not one of your colleagues who would
be willing to help you out of a temporary inconvenience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Would Van Arlen himself have found one so quickly?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! plenty!—but they want security—they want a
guarantee; and&nbsp;... do you think His Excellency would
become security for me?—or you, sir—your name will do
anything you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“My good friend, you understand that I, in my position,
cannot afford to get mixed up with any such affair, nor can
the Minister either. Try and come to some arrangement
with your landlord, but don’t expect anything from <em>these</em>
quarters, under such circumstances. We can’t have anything
to do with such matters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Teuten bowed his head—he had exhausted his
arguments, and all to no purpose; he had completely forgotten
the eloquent address, thought out last night; the
courage with which he had armed himself had oozed away—he
went out silently. But suddenly he turned back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it were <em>outside</em> the official circle, sir, could you help
me then? I could get money at an interest of one per cent.
per month—only I must have the security of one of the
superior officials.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have told you, Mr Van Teuten, that I, in my position,
cannot occupy myself with any matters of the kind. I am
sorry for you, but I can do nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man with the fine hand went away, slowly and
dejectedly, and Van Arlen was once more alone with—or
rather without—his thousand guilders.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>It is a mistake to suppose that, for the preparation of
jugged hare, a hare is necessary. Mrs Van Arlen understood
very well how to give a dinner, which, to the uninitiate,
seemed the finest kind of “company” dinner, and yet
consisted of the most commonplace everyday dishes. But
there is an infinite difference between rice in a dish and rice
in a mould—more especially when the latter is served with
lemon sauce. The ham was prepared <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mayonnaise</span></i>—Van
Arlen was so fond of that dish,—he always partook of
it when on those mysterious journeys of his; and then—you
need not have a whole ham for it, a few slices are quite
enough. Moreover, there stood, on the side-table, besides
the never-failing ginger and cheese, a silver dish with ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>little halfpenny tarts on it. It was quite a splendid dinner;
papa and uncle had each a bottle to himself, and besides
the ordinary wine glasses there were others of smaller size
for the better wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, with all this magnificence, a certain gloom prevailed
among the Van Arlens. This is the way with the great ones
of the earth; they enjoy wealth and ease without appreciating
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prigson, on the other hand, was, as usual, in excellent
spirits. He felt in nowise overawed by the splendour of the
feast, or the eight silk skirts which rustled round about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, it’s just our ordinary family dinner,” said
madame, with a pleasant little laugh. Prigson gave the
obligatory answer, and paid no attention whatever to the
material part of the dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which of you girls are going out with me this evening?”
he asked. “I can’t take all seven—three is the maximum—or
else your father will have to come too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know, Prigson, my position is such that I cannot
devote a single hour to mere enjoyment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame sighed, and said, in a compassionate tone, that
brother could form no idea of the life Van Arlen led.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt,” said Prigson; “but I admit that it is far
from appearing to most people what it really is.” Prigson
made the remark entirely without sarcastic intention, and
went on, with a smile, “I would bet something that you
haven’t even read the paper yet, Van Arlen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen usually read his daily paper from title to
imprint while taking his breakfast; but to-day he had
entirely forgotten it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t once looked into it; and here’s the proof,” he
said, taking it still unopened from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you haven’t seen my advertisement?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your advertisement?—no—did you insert one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember our talk at your office?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Van Arlen had not forgotten it for one moment, and if
Prigson had paid more attention to him, and less to Caroline
and Leida (who, in fact, were very pretty girls), he would
have noticed that Van Arlen’s looks continually took the
vague direction which indicated that his mind was elsewhere.
His wife, who noticed it, ascribed it to the responsibilities
of his office; his daughters were thinking, this
evening, more of their uncle than of him. Certainly papa
was the very type of a handsome man, but uncle had something
very distinguished about him—especially since Leida
had told them about seeing him in the club.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What advertisement is that, brother?” asked Mrs Van
Arlen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my dear Hortense, it belongs to those matters
which ladies can’t understand; but if it comes to anything,
and Van Arlen is willing to take a hand in it, he has only
to say the word. You can make your fortune over it, Van
Arlen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The word “fortune” awakened in the Van Arlens a feeling
which used to come over them day by day, and had as
regularly to be suppressed. Now, however, they were able to
give way to it for a moment, and Van Arlen himself—still
under the influence of what he had endured that afternoon—looked
at Van Noost Prigson with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How could that be done?” asked Mrs Van Arlen almost
indifferently; while all the girls, holding their breath,
looked at Prigson in order to form their own conclusions as
to whether his project were practicable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the first place, you would have to give up your
situation; in the next, to leave the place; and in the third,
to work rather harder than you do at present; but, on the
other hand, you would earn six times as much money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You evidently don’t know what the life of a Government
official is,” said Van Arlen, with a contemptuous smile at the
mention of harder work than his.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“Oh, dear, no!” said his wife; and the daughters looked
in consternation at the man who had dared to cast the
slightest doubt on the extent and importance of papa’s duties.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what now, Van Arlen?” said Prigson, seeing that
his brother-in-law seemed once more lost in a brown study,
“are you off to that office of yours again? You had better
come to the opera with us this evening; that is to say, if
these ladies are inclined to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A cold shudder—but it was one of delight—completely
overpowered the self-control of Frederica and Marie. They
scarcely knew the opera, except by name,—papa never went
there,—and it was very long since they had been invited by
any one else.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The opera?” said Van Arlen, “I don’t care about that;
it’s a sin against common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon?” asked Prigson, perplexed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, all the people there die singing—I can’t get over
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh?” said Prigson, evidently much taken aback; “well,
I never thought about that. But now I do think about it,
I should say that the opera is the most natural picture of
life. There are so many people that weep and wail all their
lives; is that so very much more unnatural than that they
should sing when they die? But, granting that it is as you
say, let’s go to an opera in which nobody dies. Isn’t <em>Don
Pasquale</em> on to-night, young ladies?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so, uncle,” answered Frederica, blushing, for
none of the girls even thought of looking at the theatrical
announcements. What was the good?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes—<em>Don Pasquale</em>. Come, Van Arlen—that’s a
comic opera—just the thing for you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t mind a
comic opera—not if it’s <em>really</em> comic,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along, then—you’re sure to like <em>Don Pasquale</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I can’t—another time, perhaps—I’ve too much to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>do to-night,” said Van Arlen, absently looking at the
alabaster clock that did not go, but nevertheless seemed able
to tell him that it was now <em>his</em> time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said his wife, “and if we’re to go to the opera we
shall have to dress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hortense! Hortense!” said Prigson, with a mischievous
glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean, Prigson? Of course I can’t let the
girls go to the opera with a strange gentleman. I’ve always
done my best, brother, to give my daughters a <em>good</em> bringing-up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Prigson was too polite to answer; Van Arlen had folded
his hands,—his wife did the same, and soliloquised in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Six of the ten tarts left over&nbsp;... perhaps the confectioner
would take them back&nbsp;... at any rate, one might
try. Leentje might go and see.... The opera&nbsp;... that
has not happened in the last ten years—what are we to do
about dresses?—we shall have to be quick about it....
Amen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her reflections were brought to an abrupt conclusion, for
Van Arlen had opened his eyes with a sigh, and once more
saw Prigson before him. Oh! what would he not have given
not to see him—to have opened his eyes in the consciousness
that he had been sleeping! Sleeping, from the moment of
meeting his brother-in-law in the street; sleeping, when the
latter reminded him of the debt, when he had been alone
after Prigson’s departure, when Van Teuten stood over him;
sleeping, too, that last quarter of an hour, when he stood
before his desk after Van Teuten had left him.... But he
had not slept—all, all was real&nbsp;... and then to go to a comic
opera on the top of that!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, Prigson, but I must go back to work
immediately, there are some documents wanted in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! so things <em>are</em> sometimes wanted in a hurry at a
Government office?” asked Prigson. “No, thank you—take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>one of my cigars—real Havannah, fifteen cents—delicious—just
try one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, uncle, it’s positively sinful!” said Leida, who had
nearly forgotten etiquette so far as to hand him a light,
which at a ceremonial dinner would have been highly
unfitting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sinful is it?... How old are you now, Leida?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eighteen next birthday, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, then—till later—no, don’t apologise. But
don’t go to sleep, Van Arlen,” Prigson shouted jocularly after
his host, and then added, turning to Leida, “A happy time
of life, Leida, I wish it were mine still;—but when I was
that age, I didn’t think fifteen cents too much to pay for
anything I liked.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you mean, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what I say, my dear girl. What is life, after all?
isn’t it always seeking for what you like, whether you understand
by that the smoking of a good Havannah, or the consciousness
of having done a good action? Enjoyment
means just what people like—and the older they are, the
more they want of it. It’s unjust of old people to say that
it’s the young ones that always want to enjoy themselves—the
old ones are just as set on it, but they get their enjoyment
out of other things. Well, any man who can get
himself one enjoyment for fifteen cents is certainly not
cheated out of his money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, uncle, must one always have money to enjoy one’s
self?” asked Leida, naïvely, but very much <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à contre cœur</span></i>—for
her whole life was in evidence to prove that, as a rule,
one must.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not, my very charming Leida,” said Prigson,
rising, and added, as he embraced his niece, “That’s a treat
for nothing, do you see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not for me, uncle,” said Leida, laughing mischievously,
as she ran out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“It’s really a pity that Van Arlen’s such a harlequin!”
muttered Van Noost Prigson to himself, and then went to
join his elder nieces at the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen was once more in his room, and had locked
the door—but he didn’t go to sleep. He had his hand in
his breast-pocket, and his fingers were clutching a little packet
that seemed to burn them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Borrowed? No—not borrowed; it was stolen—it was
not his. And yet he was not a thief—he had already as
good as put it back,—only the execution was awanting to complete
his intention. He strained his ears listening for Prigson
and the others to go out at the front door. As soon as they
were gone, he would hurry to the office and put back the
money! Why were they dawdling like that? If anything
happened to prevent his going—if he were to find the lock
out of order. Why did they not start? If there were a fire
in a street he had to pass—if he were to meet with an
accident.... Do be quick, Prigson! the money is burning
me—if I start now, we shall be in the street at the same time—then
I shall have to go with him, and he will have to walk
slowly on account of the ladies. Which way shall I go?
My hat—where did I put my hat? If Prigson were to take
my hat by mistake—happily it has a mourning band on it.
Why don’t you go, Prigson? Have you given up the plan?</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a knock at the door, and his wife entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going out, Van Arlen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear, no.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you looked as if you were going to start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not, certainly not! Go now, make haste, or
you’ll be late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you’re going to give us a surprise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no—I’ve too much to do—and I don’t care about
operas, where people die singing. Good-bye, Hortense,
good-bye! Don’t let the girls come up, I’m too busy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, at last, he heard the door close! and when Caroline,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>as the eldest available daughter, came to bring papa
his cup of tea, his room was empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa has surely gone too,” she said, as she went down
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think it’s very nice of him if he has. Why, he
said that if he went we should go too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa doesn’t care for operas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! <em>I</em> think he likes them well enough, really—only——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped herself just in time, keeping back the word,
the great word, which might be thought, but never spoken,
in the Van Arlen household.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the family came home that night Van Arlen was
even more silent than he had been at dinner, but his silence
was a dull apathetic calm. The ladies had enjoyed themselves
“<em>awfully</em>”; their flushed cheeks and dancing eyes
spoke volumes for the effect of this unwonted gaiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa, you <em>must</em> go some time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it comic opera?” asked papa.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! indeed it was—awfully!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—but <em>really</em> comic, <em>good</em> comedy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, very good,” said mamma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen’s position was too important for him to let himself
be guided by any chance person who chose to label an
opera as comic. A thing must really be what it is given out
for.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you care nothing at all for tragedy, then?”
remarked Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, not altogether that, but a tragedy must be <em>really</em>
tragic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversation, of which some fragments are thus
reported, will scarcely make the reader long to hear the rest.
The Van Arlens consistently kept up their depreciation of
sour grapes, to the great delight of Prigson, who amused
himself by defending all sorts of paradoxes. But though the
hands of the alabaster clock unchangeably pointed to half-past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>one, it was getting late. Uncle Van Noost Prigson prepared
to take his leave, and Van Arlen made no great effort
to detain him. He thought his brother-in law a good
fellow, and, under certain circumstances, an indispensable
person; to-day, however, Prigson reminded him of so much
that he would willingly have forgotten, that his presence
became well-nigh intolerable. He breathed more freely
when Prigson got up to go; and it was with a certain cheerfulness
that he remarked, as he looked out at the front door
at the stars, “I see you’ve a fine night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll hope so,” said Prigson; “but now, business for a
moment. I asked you for something this morning—not for
the sake of embarrassing you, but of getting myself out of a
hole. When can I have that money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will to-morrow evening do?” asked Van Arlen, with a
sigh of thankfulness that it was no longer in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let it be later than that—you know you’ve always
told me I could have it when I liked, otherwise I shouldn’t
have asked at such a moment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s no trouble to me!” said Van Arlen, though he
was wondering all the time where the money was to come
from.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now for my plan. I will guarantee that you get the
money back three days after the King has signed this concession—but
then you will have to work the Minister!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one is in a better position to do it; the business is
honest enough, but, like all business, it has a shady side to
it: and the authorities have a nasty way of seeing the black
before the white. There <em>is</em> some black about it, I won’t
deny; but if you can manage to show up the white, we shall
be that thousand guilders to the good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t see——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No need you should, for the moment. Take the papers
to your room, read them, think over them, and, once more,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>three days after the granting of the concession, your debt is
no longer in existence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Van Arlen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you ask—can it be reconciled with an honest
man’s conscience?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you take me for, Van Arlen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen was silent for a moment, and then said slowly,
“For a man who wants to be rich.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right, my dear fellow, and you should do the
same. With this concession your fortune is made. You
will have a situation with a salary of ten thousand guilders.”
And with a cheerful “Good-night,” Prigson departed, while
Van Arlen went up to his room.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was many hours before he rose from his chair. The
sun was shining in at the window, but he had no inclination
to sleep; he had been absorbed in the documents. He
read from beginning to end, thought for a while, folded them
up, and muttered—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven preserve me from it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thoughtfully he went to his office that morning. He
could find no solution to the Prigson question, and there
was nothing to help him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was summoned to the Minister’s presence, and found
him extraordinarily amiable—a bad sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down, Mr Van Arlen, sit down,” said His Excellency.
Van Arlen obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Van Arlen—it is possible I may be mistaken—but
it seems to me as if, just lately, you had shown—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passez-moi
le mot</span></i>—less zeal for business than I formerly thought was
the case with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your Excellency, I was not aware that I had felt less
zeal for my duties than at any other time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there anything worrying you? Your health?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is excellent, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“Domestic trouble?—it might be indiscreet to inquire—but
I take an interest in all my subordinates. Is there perhaps
any financial trouble? Just tell me freely. Our
salaries are not high, I know, but, if I am rightly informed,
you have some private means.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At your Excellency’s service,” assented Van Arlen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought so, otherwise we might have thought of offering
you some assistance in this respect. But as it is, I
suppose the extent of your work is such that it presses too
heavily on one man; and so I have been considering the
feasibility of appointing one more official to my department,
subject to His Majesty’s approval of my nomination.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen turned deathly pale; now he understood the
Minister’s friendliness, and the fate that lay before him;
he understood also that the first offer was by way of gilding
the pill. He had refused the gilding from pride, but had to
swallow the pill all the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I assure your Excellency that I do not know what work
could be entrusted to such an official.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is quite a minor detail,” said His Excellency,
naïvely. “However, I wished to consult you first about
the matter, and perhaps you will be so kind as to have the
proposal drawn up. Baron Regenstein is the person
meant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The son of your colleague?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe so; but he is a man of great acquirements,
whose help will be extremely useful to you. I shall want
the paper before two o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen bowed and rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, as to salary, we shall give him eighteen hundred
guilders.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your Excellency will allow me to remark, that in that
case you will have exceeded the estimate for the department.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we must see how we can manage with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>smaller salaries. Didn’t some one die a month or two
back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, an assistant secretary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good; and I just heard this morning that we’ve
probably lost another. Van Teuten left town quietly last
night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Van Teuten!” exclaimed Van Arlen, in consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Do you know anything in particular about
him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He came and asked me for two hundred guilders
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, why couldn’t you let him have an advance? or
you might have sent him to me; if necessary, we could have
helped him by getting up a collection. But you’re too busy
to attend to such things; it’s a good thing we’re going to have
some extra help. Good-morning, Mr Van Arlen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That, too!” said Van Arlen, when he was back in his
own room, and then called out to the messenger that he
could see no one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A gentleman has been here; he said he would come
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t see any one to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Van Arlen!” said a voice, just as the door was
closing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Impossible, sir, the Minister is in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door was shut, and the voice—and all persons with
whom it subsequently came in contact—were aware that
there was “something up,” perhaps a reorganisation of the
whole department.... So much only was certain, that
no one knew what it was but the Minister and Van Arlen,
which still further increased the latter’s importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the drawing up of a proposal for the appointment of
a supernumerary official was no joke. It was long since
Van Arlen had such a ticklish document in hand, and the only
reason it seemed to him that he could give was,—“Whereas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>it is our pleasure&nbsp;... to supersede Van Arlen.” At last,
however, he found the way to do it. By noon the document
was ready, and one of the copying clerks, in whose
discretion he placed unlimited confidence, was sent for to
prepare the mysterious paper for its high destiny, in Van
Arlen’s own room. At a quarter to two it was fairly written
out, and Van Arlen presented himself before the Minister,
who took the document, thanked him courteously, and
glanced through it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have forgotten the date when the new appointment
is to begin,—the 1st of the following month,” said
His Excellency, in a tone which clearly conveyed: “Really,
Mr Van Arlen, your work is too much for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen returned to his room with the paper in his
hand, and found Prigson at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, Van Arlen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, Prigson; I haven’t a moment to spare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it now? Country in danger? What’s that
document?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ministerial business.... Where is Mr Zuigman?”
This to the messenger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone away, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him to come here immediately.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But after his highly important activity in his superior’s
private room, the copying clerk Zuigman had understood
that he was in need of some slight recreation, and, alleging
a commission in town, he had gone off for a stroll round
the square. His immediate superior had given him leave
at once. One doesn’t refuse modest requests like that to a
man perceptibly high in Van Arlen’s favour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What now?” said Van Arlen. “My head is going round.
Zuigman must come to my room the very first thing to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I help you, Van Arlen? What is it has to be
done?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>“Writing, man, writing!—a proposal addressed to the
King that will have to come before the Cabinet Council....
I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you do it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I!” said Van Arlen, in consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, a good writing is not your strong point,” laughed
Prigson, “otherwise you never would have risen so high.
The man with the worst hand gets on best, because they
can’t keep him on as a copying clerk. Just give me a pen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Prigson, it’s a great document! strictly secret—no
one is to know anything about it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll promise not to tell; let’s have a look.” And before
Van Arlen could prevent it, his brother-in-law had already
glanced over the paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven be good to us! a magnificent bargain!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bargain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, of course! Now-a-days it’s not their own sons
that ministers help forward; they do it for each other’s.
Regenstein is to get this, and your man’s son has just been
put into a good thing by his father’s colleague. Splendid
exchange! Did you draw up the proposal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no time now, Prigson. Do be kind enough to
let me alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen rang the bell, and sent for one of the clerks.
Van Teuten entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Van Teuten!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, I have—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll see to that presently. Sit down, Mr Van Teuten,
and write—here—recopy this page; but mind you put in the
insertion! The first time a document of mine has been disfigured
by an insertion! My head’s going!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Teuten wrote as he was told, and in a quarter of an
hour the work was finished. He perceived, with visible
complacency, how much better his writing was than that of
his colleague.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>“Two different kinds of writing! Never yet happened
with a document of mine; and it’s got to go to the King
and the Cabinet Council!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words Van Arlen rushed out of the room,
leaving Prigson alone with Van Teuten.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you copy decently?” asked Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I venture to say, sir, that there isn’t another hand like
mine in this department.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you earn at this work, now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Six hundred guilders, sir. Mr Van Arlen has perhaps
told you that I am financially in circumstances of great
difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it is indeed too little for a man who writes a hand
like that; but surely you’re out of all your troubles now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I?—I just wish I were!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, a man who knows all about a secret document
like this need not be poor any longer than he likes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Secret, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most particularly so,” said Prigson, turning away, while
Van Teuten considered with himself whether it could
really be the case, and whether, if so, he could profit by it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen came back, thanked the copying clerk, and
recommended him to keep the matter secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prigson stole a glance at Van Teuten, who was now
convinced of the truth of his words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you want anything, Mr Van Teuten?” asked Van
Arlen, for the man remained standing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I venture to remind you of my request yesterday,
sir? Perhaps you know that&nbsp;... that I&nbsp;... yesterday....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know—nothing takes place in this department
without my knowledge; but the Minister and I have agreed
to take no notice of such ill-considered action on the part
of a member of this department—provided, of course, it is
never repeated.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“No, sir, I give you my word it shall not. Oh, if you
had only known what I felt this morning, when I thought of
my wife and children searching for me! I couldn’t stand it
any longer, sir, and I came back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wisest thing you could have done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that does not save me! I have obtained two days’
respite; but after that—I am hopelessly lost, if no help
comes. If you will allow me, sir, I will go before the court
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do better for you than that,—I’ll send a subscription
list round the office, and let you have the amount. His
Excellency is sure to put his name down too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if there is any deficiency, I’ll make it up,” said
Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly a State secret,” thought Van Teuten, amazed
and confused at the turn matters had taken,—which he
ascribed entirely to the secret. He too was involved in it,—but,
alas! he had read nothing, that was not his habit.
A good copying clerk never reads—he only writes. “To
begin on Aug. 1st,”—that was all he could remember. But
it must be a secret of the highest importance,—and the
stranger who seemed to have the principal share in the
business was—yes, what could he be? Then he remembered
that Talm had spoken of an English millionaire, introduced
by him at the White Club, and somehow connected with
Van Arlen;—but the millionaire, according to Talm, knew
not a word of Dutch—it was for that very reason that Van
Arlen had entrusted him to Talm’s guidance; and now the
secret document, and the unexpected help, and the change
in his fortunes—had Van Arlen, perhaps, been raised to the
ministry?...</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen and Prigson were left alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you look over my papers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And——?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>“I don’t want to be in it; your business is not—not
honest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you call honest, Van Arlen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I expressed myself rather harshly—it is not
what it seems to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>You</em> say that?” sneered Prigson. “Come, Van Arlen,
<em>that</em> can be no reason for you to dislike a thing. But we’ll
grant that it is more profitable for the contractor than for the
State—that’s a matter of course. Do you think we’re going
to make the State presents, while the Ministers put their sons
into all the fat Government places? Just tell me, on your
conscience, Van Arlen, is that an honest business, that
appointment? I bet something you had a heap of trouble
to give the thing a decent appearance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, there’s a present of eighteen hundred
guilders being made to Regenstein. I suppose your Minister’s
son is getting double that? And am I to be fool enough
not to get my share out of the ‘Widow Woman’ too? Let’s
be wise, and follow the good example set us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen was silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall I tell you something? The functionary now being
smuggled in—for whose coming you have been obliged to
find the reasons—is really appointed in order to oust you.
He is to do your work, and you are to become supernumerary,
and then who knows how soon you’ll be pensioned off?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I shall fall honourably.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cold comfort that; it’s surely no dishonour to prevent
the blow. Once more, I’ll give you a receipt for that debt;
I offer you a well-paid position, and if the concern comes to
smash—for that <em>might</em> happen—I will guarantee that you
shall lose nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you admit that the thing is not honest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My good Van Arlen, you’re the very type of infantile
innocence. If it were quite safe and certain to be profitable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>I could do without your help. One word more,—if you still
refuse, Regenstein is a good friend of mine; he gets his
appointment on the first, and within a month from that
date I shall get what I want without applying to you. Just
think over that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson, you are a tempter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Van Arlen, you are a fool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it should come out that I have been playing a double
game?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If this Minister is still in office, just remind him of that
appointment; if there is another, you can lay the blame on
his predecessor, and the disorder occasioned by the unnecessary
nomination of new officials.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—I took an oath——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And didn’t the Minister do so too? Come, shut up
shop for to-day, and come and dine with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? Yesterday I was your guest, to-day you are
mine. I am staying at the Bellevue; but if there are too
many princes there for your taste, we’ll go and dine at the
Badhuis restaurant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Impossible; I can’t leave the office till four. If you’ll
believe me, Prigson, I envy the clerks, who can take their
hats and go whenever they like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The burdens of greatness.... So you’re free at four,
are you? Well, I’ll drive round and fetch you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly, at four, Prigson arrived in a cab, and conveyed
not only Van Arlen, but his wife and Leida, to the
garden restaurant at Scheveningen known as the Badhuis.
They dined sumptuously, and did not even refuse champagne.
This was an unheard-of event in their lives—but they were
not paying the bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>After dinner, as they were sitting on the terrace, they
perceived Mr Talm. Mr Talm had on flesh-coloured kid
gloves, and an eye-glass prominently fixed in his left eye,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>the cord waving in the wind like the web of a gigantic
spider. Talm was quite presentable, and, being now of
opinion that the Van Arlens were presentable also, he
accosted them, and was honoured with an invitation to join
their party.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame thought it would be nice to walk up and down
the terrace, and Leida also showed herself pleased with the
idea. Talm offered his escort, and Prigson was once more
alone with his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The business is clinched now, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Van Arlen, “I have been thinking it over,
and I must abide by my first answer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a pity,” said Prigson—“a pity for you—for, as I
said, the matter will have to be got into shape without you;
but I should have liked to have you in it, because I’m heartily
sorry for you. Just excuse me a minute,” he went on, rising
and signalling to a stranger, who was casting sinister glances
at the teacups—“it is my friend Valtoucourt, one of the
associate concessionaires.... I’m sorry, for I could have
introduced you to each other—in fact, I shall have to do it
after all,”—and Prigson, continuing in French, presented
Baron de Valtoucourt to his brother-in-law, for whom he
invented a high-sounding title on the spur of the moment.
Van Arlen had never thought that his name would sound so
well in French. But French was not his forte, and now his
silence made him seem more solemn than ever; and he was
convinced in his soul that Baron Valtoucourt thought him
the pivot of all the home and foreign politics of Holland.
Prigson did his best to strengthen this hypothetical opinion.
“You see, my dear fellow,” he said to the stranger, “if Van
Arlen is willing, he can do anything, but he is fond of raising
objections—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce cher</span></i> Van Arlen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger muttered, with amazing rapidity, a long
French sentence, of which Van Arlen could not seize a
word. He therefore confined himself to ejaculating now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>and then “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oui</span></i>” or “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut-être</span></i>,” and at the close wrapped
himself in a diplomatic silence. His wife and Leida
returned with their cavalier; the stranger greeted them with
a bow, as deep and solemn as though he were announcing
her death-sentence to the Queen of Spain; he then bowed
no less deeply to Talm, who, on his part, was not to be outdone,
and, deeply impressed by the high solemnity of the
occasion, made another low bow before Van Arlen. The
latter, having witnessed the performance three times, involuntarily
saluted his assistant secretary in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was, in fact, most impressively solemn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger was a man who knew life, and could understand
that a man might fill a highly important position
without being an accomplished French scholar. He therefore
slackened the flow of his words, and assured them that
he should consider it a great honour to have Van Arlen as
a director.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” said Van Arlen, “I never said that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Si, si</em>,” said the stranger, “we understand one another
perfectly;” and then he pressed his hand and gave utterance
to a friendly wish, whereat Van Arlen (unwilling to acknowledge
even to himself that he did not understand) replied,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous verrons</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning he sent for his wife and Leida to his own
room, and completely bewildered them, first by swearing them
to secrecy with regard to a conversation they had neither heard
nor understood, and next by completely losing his temper,
when Leida innocently asked: “Why, papa, you frighten me—one
would think it was high treason!” He was so violent
that Leida went off into hysterics, the girls came up to see
what was the matter, and Van Arlen left for the office in a
very bad temper.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found that Prigson had been there, and was coming
back at three o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Minister not only refused to have anything to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>with the subscription list for Van Teuten, but hinted disapprobation
of those who had got it up; and let fall
expressions which tortured Van Arlen all the morning,
making him wonder whether His Excellency had penetrated
his secret. At last Van Teuten came, and he was forced to
acknowledge his failure. The poor man, nearly in despair,
was about to make a last effort, and ask the Minister to
become security for him, when Van Arlen had a luminous
idea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will——” he said. Van Teuten was overwhelming
him with thanks and blessings, when he interrupted him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“On these conditions I will become security. First, the
money must be here by two; secondly, you must borrow,
not two hundred, but twelve hundred; thirdly, the whole
matter must be kept secret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Teuten was ready to promise anything,—he would
willingly have made him a present of his soul into the bargain.
Not long afterwards a former Government clerk, who was
now “in business on his own account,” was admitted to
Van Arlen’s private room. The money-lender was inclined
to make objections—twelve hundred guilders was a large
sum for a clerk whose income only amounted to the half of
that sum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I don’t raise that difficulty,” said Van Arlen indifferently,
“I see no reason why you should.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you see—but you are mortal like the rest of us;
you might have to retire, or be put on half-pay—excuse my
suggesting such things, but they’re all possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re not lending money to me, but to Mr Van
Teuten; if anything of the sort were to happen, he would
find you a new security.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the matter was settled, at an interest of seven
and a half per cent. The money-lender produced the twelve
hundred guilders, and carried off the bill, duly stamped, and
signed by Van Arlen and Van Teuten.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>When the man with the handwriting was once more alone
with his chief, the latter said, “Two hundred guilders are
all you want for the present; I’ll keep the rest for you, in case
you should get into difficulties again. Never mind about the
interest—I’ll pay that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Teuten was fairly dazzled by such liberality. There
must be something behind it—probably the State secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news went like wildfire through the department how
that unlucky devil of a Van Teuten had been set on his legs
again by Van Arlen! Zuigman knew what to think of it—<em>he</em>
had seen documents; but he never spoke, and that his
colleagues knew right well.</p>

<p class='c009'>Talm, too, had his say on the subject,—Talm, who had
introduced the millionaire, and had, yesterday evening,
walked on the terrace at Scheveningen arm in arm with his
chief’s wife. Further and further spread the fire, and every
one made his conjectures. Van Teuten’s rescue remained
the great event of the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>It struck three, when Prigson was announced. Van Arlen
was deep in his work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What zeal! But of course you want to leave the books
in good order when you go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not thinking of going, Prigson.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say? And our agreement?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have made no definite agreement; but, in so far as I
have made any promise to join you, I withdraw it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the deuce! Van Arlen, aren’t you right in your
head?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the contrary, I have come to my senses. When one
has been an honest man for thirty years, Prigson, one is
thoroughly in love with honesty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Especially the way it is appreciated! The reward of all
your honesty will be, that you fall from the tree, like an
over-ripe fruit, and lie there till somebody treads you flat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better so than trample on one’s self.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>“That is a gymnastic feat I would rather leave to a Münchausen.
But you’re mad, Van Arlen—the matter is getting
into shape after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think so?” Van Arlen stood up, and looked his
brother-in-law straight in the face. “Do you think I would
ever allow it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My good friend, you won’t be asked. Regenstein is
going to negotiate the business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’ll inform the Minister. The supernumerary will
be on his guard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like the dying gladiator—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">moriturus salutat</span></i>—it’s heroic,
but comic too. I’d be more sensible, if I were you, Van
Arlen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson, when I came here this morning, with the feeling
that I had broken my oath and betrayed my country....
Oh! I couldn’t stay here a day—I couldn’t live—I should
lay hands on myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Treason—perjury—you do choose such fine words! and
the real point is, whether you’re going to depart from an old
habit or not. Believe me, you’re the slave of habit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I prefer to remain so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Prigson looked at him, and saw that his mind was made
up. But he had one resource left, “Well, I suppose you’re
your own master, and can do as you like.... But I’m
sorry—I shall have to remind you of what I asked you for
the other day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen put his hand in his breast-pocket, and laid a
small parcel on the table before Prigson, “Will you kindly
see if that’s all right?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prigson was disappointed. He did not need the money—in
fact, Van Arlen’s utter inability to pay would have been
worth another thousand guilders to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose it’s all right,” he said, glancing over the notes.
“There, Van Arlen,” he said, with a sudden change of tone,
and a quaver in his voice, “give me your hand, old fellow!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>you’re better than most men. Good-bye! Stay as you
are!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He left the room, and Van Arlen, finding himself alone,
felt like a man saved from shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is some weeks after the first of August. The new
official has long been installed, and the Minister does nothing
without consulting him. Everything passes through Mr
Regenstein’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is Sunday afternoon. On Sunday afternoons, as a rule,
it is too hot for a walk; or, if not too hot, it is too cold. If
neither too hot nor too cold, it most likely threatens rain;
and if none of these three atmospheric conditions prevails,—well,
formerly Van Arlen always had urgent work to do.
This Sunday, however, he is quite at leisure, and the weather
is perfect, but—it is the anniversary of Aunt Cornelia’s
death.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen looks over the blinds at the passers-by, most
of whom are on their way to the Bosch. Here and there a
quietly dressed lady, with a Bible in her hand, threads her
way through the throng.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I’ll go to afternoon church,” says Caroline.
“Will you come, Frederica?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, Caroline,” answers Frederica, with a little sigh,
and they go.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leida and Hendrika made a slight grimace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa really might go out for a walk with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, fie! girls!” said their mother, “that would not be
at all proper on a day like this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t we keep the day just as well to-morrow,
mamma?” asked Leida simply. “I don’t see why we
should have to keep it up for twenty years; I’m quite sure
that Uncle Van Noost Prigson himself doesn’t remember it
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The name made Van Arlen look up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa—have you heard anything more about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>situation uncle was talking about at dinner that day?” asked
Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all come to nothing, dear child; I have been
talking it over, but they say they can’t do without me at the
office.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, papa,” asked Hortense, “if they can’t do without
you, how does it happen that you have less to do than you
had?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does the importance of a position lie in the mere
amount of work?” asked Van Arlen, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa has this secret business now, you see,” said his
wife, anxious to help him out—she was looking straight
before her. “This business is, by itself, of tremendous
importance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that since Uncle Prigson was here?” asked Leida,
going up to her father, and laying her arm over his shoulder.
“You’re not angry with me any more, are you, papa?—you
know—since that morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen bent down to his daughter and kissed her on
the forehead. “No, little girl,—I can’t be angry with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you never travel now, papa. Has that part of your
work been taken away? That’s stupid!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The travelling has come to an end,” said Van Arlen
thoughtfully,—“come to an end for good and all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The item “Travelling expenses,” in the Van Arlen budget,
was now replaced by another, which was, “Instalments and
interest on debt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a pity,” said Caroline, “because now you can never
take two of us with you, as you promised to do long ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That plan has come to nothing too, child. Besides,
I’m getting old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa!—you old! that’s the first we’ve heard of it.
It must be since you gave up your glass of wine at dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa has to keep his head clear, you see,” said Mrs Van
Arlen. “That’s the penalty of greatness, girls!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>She was silent, and they all followed suit. No one had
anything more to say. If only a caller would come!—but
since papa had entered on his important position as supernumerary
in the office, callers had been scarce. So the dull
Sunday wore away. The two eldest girls came home from
church; the dinner hour drew near, and, still in silence, the
Van Arlens took their places round the big table, on which
a soup tureen was the only dish visible. It does not take
long to eat soup, and the dessert, as usual, remained untouched.
Already Leentje had stuck her shining Sunday
face, and her hat with the flowers in it, through a crack of
the door, to give notice of her departure—for it was her
day out, and “it suited.” The family were still seated
round the table. Why should they rise?—the evening was
long enough. Suddenly, however, they were startled out of
their inertia by the front door bell. Leida went to answer
it, and immediately returned with Van Noost Prigson. Van
Arlen felt himself turn pale—was he to be tempted again?</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife, too, was seized with panic—supposing Prigson
had not dined! Fortunately, he set her mind at ease forthwith.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I left the dinner-table before dessert, fearing that otherwise
I should not find you at home. I suppose you’re going
to Scheveningen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; it’s rather too crowded for me at the Badhuis on
Sundays,” said Van Arlen, feeling that it would not quite do
to allege to the widower the anniversary of his wife’s death
as their reason for remaining at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Crowded! The father of seven daughters ought simply
to revel in crowds. What do you say, nieces?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The nieces had no opinion to offer on that point.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, Van Arlen,” Prigson went on, throwing himself
back in his chair, and surveying the seven girls, one by one,
with a well-pleased expression,—“really, my dear fellow, you
ought not to stay at home on Sunday evenings! At any
rate you should send your daughters to church.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>The younger ones looked mischievously at Caroline and
Frederica.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has always struck me as strange, Van Arlen, that there
are so many old maids at the Hague. What in the world
is the cause of that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because the girls are rather hard to please, uncle,” said
Leida.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s the reason, is it?” said Prigson, with an air
of simple faith. “I’m sorry to hear it—I’ve just come to
look for a wife at the Hague.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For Cousin Cornelius, uncle?” asked Leida. “I
suppose he’s about twenty now, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for nothing, girl! And have you heard, Van
Arlen?” he continued, turning to his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” asked the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you know well enough,—you’re only pretending,
because you want to make out it’s a State secret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On my word, as an honest man——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s worth something, as we know. So you haven’t
heard? Next week your Minister’s going to resign.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The day before yesterday, it was brought before the
Cabinet Council, and His Majesty made as little difficulty
over the matter as I should have done. He’ll get the Grand
Cross now, and perhaps be Minister of State—but <em>you’ll</em> be
rid of him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen sat looking at his brother-in-law, without
moving a muscle of his face, and the girls felt convinced
that papa knew just as much about the business as
Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the best of it all is, that your friend Regenstein has
been doing his level best to pull His Excellency down!
Well—reap as you’ve sown!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson, we’re not alone here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see no earthly reason why your wife and daughters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>may not know it. I hate these mysteries. They may shout
the whole thing from the housetops, for all I care.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But think of my position!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be greatly improved, Van Arlen. Regenstein
has made his own terms, like a sensible man; but I’ll tell
you about that later. As soon as I heard that His Excellency
was going to close his portfolio, I came to the Hague
at once; last night I had a talk with him, and now my
business is done. The Minister wasn’t of the same mind
as a certain fellow I know, when <em>he</em> found himself set aside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Prigson!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All men are not equally conscientious, my dear man.
His Excellency had too much common sense to make
difficulties,—but that’s not to the point. Enough that the
matter’s settled! By Jove, but I’m sick of it! To Amsterdam
yesterday—to Rotterdam this morning—but now I’m
going to get some rest!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen shook his head doubtfully over such lack of
principle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And are you remaining in town some days?” asked
Madame, with distinction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That depends, Hortense. I’ve told you what I came for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle is sorry for the Hague ladies,” said Leida. “But
remember, uncle, they’re very hard to please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I shall have to run off with one. What would
you do, Van Arlen, if a fellow ran off with one of your
daughters?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson, my daughters are far too well brought up, ever
to be exposed to the danger of such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But supposing a man comes and proposes in due form?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it’s going to rain,” said Marie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! isn’t that picture hanging all on one side,”
exclaimed Hendriek, at the same moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma, have you noticed that the edge of the tablecloth
is all ravelled out here?” asked Hortense.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Frederica rose to pick up her napkin, which she had
dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we have tea in the front or back room, mamma?”
asked Antoinette, whose turn it was to see to the housekeeping
this week; and they rose, followed by Caroline, who
went over to mamma, to whisper a very confidential communication
with regard to a ribbon in the latter’s cap.
Leida was lighting a spill for papa. “You might as well
ask, uncle, what is the amount of the dowry papa is going
to give us,” she said, handing Uncle Prigson a light at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty girls need no dowry,” answered Prigson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks for the compliment to your nieces,” said Leida,
with a roguish curtsey, as she left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prigson and Van Arlen were once more alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson,” said the official, “I must repeat to you candidly
what I have already told you—you’re not playing a
fair game.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think I want to turn your daughters’ heads?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean that—your enterprise, which now seems
about to succeed——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, which <em>is</em> going to succeed; but let that matter rest
just now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely you have a conscience, Prigson?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An amazingly big one, Van Arlen; and, between ourselves,
I think it’s made of some elastic substance, most
likely of the same material as your Minister’s and your friend
Regenstein’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson! Prigson! a time will come——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! Van Arlen, what a platitude!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re scoffing, Prigson; but listen, you set store by the
respect of your fellow-creatures—mine, for instance; you
told me once that I was better than many men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well remembered; but have I forfeited that respect?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not quite, yet—but still——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“The greater part? Good. Now the proof of the sum;
Van Arlen, I want to ask you for the hand of your daughter.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“Prigson, do remember that we are discussing serious
matters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Van Arlen, I’m speaking as seriously as I ever did
in my life. Your Leida is a nice, pleasant, merry girl, with
a good heart, and—excuse my having seen a little deeper
into your domestic economy than perhaps you like—Leida
knows how to keep house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your age!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you reckon by the heart or the head?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might be her father!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I had six more daughters, like you, I wouldn’t envy
their position. I don’t understand, Van Arlen, why you
should make any difficulty about it; a father of seven girls
ought surely to be glad enough to get rid of one of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You forget that a daughter’s marriage involves expenses
too heavy for a household like mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will bear the cost of everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen was silent, and reflected. He had just been
calling Prigson a dishonest man,—was he going to give
him his daughter? Could he answer for such a step to his
own conscience?... But it was a good match after all&nbsp;...
and then&nbsp;... seven daughters! And the outfit! But
perhaps that was only a nominal present after all&nbsp;...; perhaps
Prigson only meant to reckon it as cancelling the
money still due to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our debt—” he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cancelled on the wedding-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The prospect was, in truth, a seductive one; but how
could he give his daughter to a man without a conscience?
Suddenly there occurred to him a way of escape, which
united in itself all possible advantages.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>“Prigson, with me everything must give way to my
children’s happiness; I have never forced any of them into
a marriage” (in fact, the opportunity had never offered),
“and I would not attempt to prevent a union which——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Arlen paused—Prigson waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which may, perhaps, lead to your happiness—even your
higher happiness, Prigson. The influence over you may
have the power to inspire you with better feelings, with—let
me speak plainly—more moral principles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an inspiration of the moment,—but Van Arlen, by
this time, was quite convinced that it was his principal
motive in consenting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you let us hope so, Van Arlen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would not Caroline, who is nearer your own age——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am convinced that Leida’s influence will act on me
more powerfully,” said Prigson, humbly. “What do you
think of taking a drive out to the baths now? I shall have
a better chance of getting a few words with Leida than here,
where there are always six more of them sitting sorrowing
that the offer was not for them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think my daughters would take that view of
each other’s happiness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come! we’re getting on!—you call it happiness, do you?
Will you have a fly ordered?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The nearest driver is a Roman Catholic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, of course he must not drive us; that would begin to
play the mischief with the moral principles at once. I’ll go
and find a Calvinist cabman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That same evening Leida called her uncle by his first
name; and in two months’ time the Van Arlens were giving
a ball in honour of the engagement,—a thing they had never
done before,—with Prigson’s money. Talm appeared at this
festivity; and the man with the handwriting, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>accustomed to amuse his leisure hours with the clarionet
(purely for the love of art, of course), also assisted—at a
distance. He told his friends next morning that he had
been one of the invited guests, and that Mr Talm would
probably get a good piece of promotion before long, for he
had been dancing all the evening with one and the same
Miss Van Arlen—who, moreover, gave him her bouquet
when he left!</p>

<p class='c009'>The ball had important consequences, moreover, for five
more of the Van Arlen girls; and the old man now lives on
his pension, with his wife and eldest daughter. He often
calls to mind his important position,—especially the time
when he was entrusted with such very, very confidential
business, of which no one knew anything at the time, and no
one knows anything to this day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The milkman must be made to understand that it will not
do to ring people out of their beds at seven in the morning,
and make them catch cold at the front door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pianos are not to be locked by the family after using; the
servants would like a little music now and then.</p>

<p class='c009'>The master and mistress must consult the servants before
subscribing to newspapers and magazines. The foolish
choice that is often made in this respect is very trying to the
feelings of the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another practice that cannot be too strongly reprobated,
is that of carrying off books and magazines from the circulating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>library to people’s bedrooms before the servants have
read them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame and the daughters of the house should always
knock properly before entering the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>When visiting the servants’ own rooms, they should always
send some one up to announce them first.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the housemaid is sent to order a cab, it by no
means follows that she is to tell the cabman to drive her
home by the shortest way.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the master and mistress are medically attended by a
Professor, it will not do to let the servants be treated by an
ordinary doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stale bread will no longer be eaten.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a serious misfortune is impending—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, a bankruptcy
or the like—the servants ought always to be warned
in time.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the family have a box at the theatre or the opera, the
servants should have the full use of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The family should not speak French at table while the
maid is in the room, unless it has been previously ascertained
that she understands that language.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>THE STORY OF A BOUQUET.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Alfred possessed two qualities common to many young men
besides himself,—he was in love, and he had very little money.</p>

<p class='c009'>His condition was therefore a sad one; but he cherished
the hope that the lovely Clara would not only make a good
wife, but also put an end to all his pecuniary embarrassments.
So he neglected nothing that he thought might please her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every one knows that homage when offered in the shape
of flowers is, as a rule, well pleasing to ladies. But, unhappily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>the world is at present so prosaically constituted,
that even the perfumed children of Flora are not to be had
except for money,—and this point constituted, as we have
already seen, the Achilles sinew of our enamoured here.</p>

<p class='c009'>Day and night his thoughts were occupied with this
difficulty, and, when it did not keep him awake, his sleep
was filled with uncomfortable dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>After one of these weary nights, another bright morning
had dawned,—the larks were singing, the roses were in
bloom, and Alfred was busy cleaning his pipe.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of this poetic occupation, he was suddenly
inspired with a practical idea. He sketched out a plan which
would have done no discredit to the most finished diplomatist,
and executed it with an energy worthy of a worse cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been accustomed to sell his cast-off garments to a
humble citizen of much experience in retail trading; and,
considering the man’s astuteness and eloquence, he had
often been seized by a suspicion that he (Alfred) had not
got the best of the bargain.</p>

<p class='c009'>This must be put an end to. He broke off his commercial
relations with the experienced dealer, and concluded a
treaty with a nursery-gardener’s boy, to whom he presented
his worn-out clothes; in return for which the boy engaged
to gather him a bouquet, from time to time, late in the
evening, and bring it to him with the necessary discretion.</p>

<p class='c009'>This plan answered well enough for a time. The boy
brought the flowers, and received in return, gifts of equal value,—a
hat, adorned with dints like a Homeric shield; a waistcoat,
wofully stained down the front; and a coat, whose collar
shone like a meteor; and furthermore, a pair of shoes, on
which the cobbler’s art could no further go.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the morning of a bright summer day, the gardener’s
boy, being unable to come in person, sent up by another
hand a magnificent bouquet of roses, which Alfred, without
loss of time, despatched to his adored Clara.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Full of joyous hope, and sure of a friendly welcome, he
sped the same evening to the house of his chosen one, but
found, to his great disappointment, that he was received
with decided coolness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You sent me a note this morning,” began Clara, after an
awkward pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A note?” he asked, in astonishment; “I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, with the flowers—”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_349.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“YES, WITH THE FLOWERS—”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I did send some flowers—roses——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Into which this note was stuck,” went on Clara, freezingly.
“Here it is—do you deny having sent it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she handed the miserable man a piece of paper, on
which he read, to his consternation—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Don’t forget the old boots you said you would give me last
week.</em>”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><em>UNBIDDEN GUESTS.</em></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c025'>I.</h3>

<p class='c021'>Notary van Elst generally comes home from his
office about five in the afternoon, and his return to
the bosom of his family is a pretty sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Van Elsts’ neighbour,—unsociable old bachelor that
he was,—noticing how eagerly this return was watched for
every afternoon and greeted with joyful acclamation, had a
way of turning away his head, and muttering crossly, “I
might have known that sort of thing too, if only——”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the <em>bendy</em><a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> sent to fetch Van Elst, the curly head
of his eldest child was always to be seen; Nonnie and
little Ada were always watching for him on the verandah
steps when he drove up; and no sooner did the wheels
crunch over the gravel than a pretty little wife would come
flying out with the brightest, pleasantest face imaginable,
which she never forgot to hold up for the kiss which was
always forthcoming, unless the children interfered, clinging
about him as they did, and clamouring for attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came an interval of peace. Papa went to dress,
and mamma sent the little ones out for a walk; and when the
old bachelor returned to his verandah,—having been away
for his bath meanwhile,—he would see his gentle little
neighbour seated at the tea-tray as placidly as if she had
not been busy the whole day running here and there,—now
urging a perverse “boy” to work, now disposing of a contumacious
pedlar or unreasonable <em>lengànan</em>,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> or, most frequent
occupation of all, flying to soothe the children in
the countless infantine woes and accidents which were
always occurring.</p>

<p>“WHEN THE OLD BACHELOR RETURNED TO HIS VERANDAH.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>It really <em>was</em>, and not merely in the old bachelor’s fancy,
a pretty sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife got all the newspapers and letters, and the
master of the house innumerable cups of tea. He would
retail all the items of news,—she, the children’s pretty sayings
and doings; and if she felt a craving to unburden herself of
domestic grievances, she found him ready to listen, as far as
appearances went, at least.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there no news to-day?” she asks, when the little
disturbers of the peace have been sent out, and her husband
throws himself back luxuriously in his lounging-chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! yes, a great piece of news. Just guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! come; do tell me. You know I hate guessing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, a letter from our cousins the Martendijks.
Where on earth did I put it? Oh! here it is in my coat
pocket. Well, there’s not much in it, except that they ask
if we will have them on a visit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <em>Martendijks</em>!” Jo exclaims, her face lengthening.
But immediately she recollects that they are relations of her
husband’s; and as this is rather a sore point with him, she
hastens to add: “What do <em>you</em> say to it, Max?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you see,” answers Max, “I have been wondering
whether we should not write that you are not yet strong
enough for visitors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo does not indeed look strong, with her fitful colour, and
that languid droop of the eyelids, but, like most mothers of
a family who know how ill they can be spared, she is loath
to allow that she is not robust, and does her best to persuade
herself and every one else that, once she has got
over this or that, she will be perfectly strong.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; you must not do that. We can’t let them stay on
at that hot Soeka-Manies, especially with the bad season
coming on. When do they propose to come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the 5th.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good gracious! the day after to-morrow! And I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>to put clean curtains on the beds! They might have given
us longer notice, I think. Surely Emily knows as well as I
do that there are always some arrangements to make in a
busy household.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then am I to write that they are welcome?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; we can’t well do anything else. Another cup of
tea, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here follows a pause. Mr Van Elst puffs away contentedly
at his cigar, while his wife begins to fidget a little.
At last, laying her hand on her husband’s, she says, hesitatingly,
“Do you know why their coming is not very
convenient just now, dear boy? the <em>godown</em> is nearly
empty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Empty <em>again</em>? My dear Jo, what on earth becomes of
the things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And as if this remark—a favourite one with married
men, and generally as unjust as it is senseless—were not
enough, he continues, in an aggrieved tone: “Good
gracious, child! it is not three months since I ordered in a
whole supply. Are the four boxes of wine finished? And
all those tinned things? And all the casks of butter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not yet. If no visitors were coming, we could easily
hold out for another month; but you absolutely must order
in a new supply now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A new supply! And the beer not paid for yet at the
bazaar! It’s all very well for you to talk, but you forget it’s
easier to order than to pay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Max! how can you speak so?” was Jo’s only
answer. She might, if she chose, have retorted that it was
he who drank so much wine,—though certainly <em>she</em> required
the stimulant more than he did,—that the tins were rarely
opened except on the numerous occasions when he brought
home friends to dinner, and that it was he who grumbled if
the dinner ever chanced to be a little scrimp. But she
made no remark, and merely turned a piteous little face to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>her husband, which resulted in his immediately exclaiming:
“Well, dear! don’t worry about it.” And then he continued,
impelled to vent his wrath on something,—“But
living is so confoundedly dear here, that a fellow is at his
wits’ end to know what to do. And then come visitors to
ruin you altogether.... They asked for an answer by
wire,” he added, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it does cost a good deal of money,” said Jo;
“but, oh dear! if it is to please them!—”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the morning of the 5th came, the Van Elsts’
neighbour over the way congratulated himself on his single
blessedness, remarking to his dog, “That’s what comes of
getting married.” He relented after a little, however, when
his cup of coffee had put him in a somewhat better humour,
and added: “After all, Van Elst is not so much more tied
than I am. It isn’t often he’s interfered with. It’s a marvel
how that woman always finds time for everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day, however, Mrs Van Elst found it rather difficult to
fit in everything. She was dreadfully busy; and, as might
be expected, lost her temper a little, got cross with the
“boys,” gave Nonnie a push, and Max a sharp answer,
and then was stung with remorse, and said, resentfully,
“that she could not understand why Cousin Martendijk
had not written sooner; it was such short notice,—such a
nuisance!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was indeed. For when Van Elst came home at mid-day,
and she met him with the query if everything did not
look nice? he saw by her flushed cheeks, and the dark
rings under her eyes, that she had over-exerted herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, very nice indeed; but you have been doing far too
much again,” he said, reproachfully. “Do take a rest now,”
he added, pouring her out a glass of port.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks, dear; but I must go and dress first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, presently,” he said, as he seated himself beside
her on the couch, holding her back as she struggled to free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>herself, and then resorting to endearments and caresses
which he well knew would retard her escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently a carriage drove up to the door. Jo sprang up
in dismay, and made a bold attempt at flight; but she was
caught in the act, and found herself face to face with the
Martendijks! Very smart did Mrs Martendijk look in her
white gown, flounced and embroidered; and Jo became
painfully conscious of her own dishevelled hair, her soiled
and crumpled <em>kabaja</em>, and old faded <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sarong</span></i><a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My wife was just going to dress,” remarked Van Elst,
aware of her embarrassment; “we did not expect you
before two o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, so we wrote; but we changed our plans. It would
have made us so late for luncheon, and that does not suit
my complaint, you see,” said Martendijk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had sent me word, I’d have made a point of
being ready,” said Jo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, of course, I had not time to think of that with all
the bustle of starting. How d’ye do, Njo?”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Now the reader must know that Njo, to whom Mrs
Martendijk addressed this remark, was the Van Elsts’ pride
and joy. They had two dear little girls besides—very fine
children, too,—but Njo; their Njo! when <em>he</em> came into the
room, the father’s and mother’s eyes wandered involuntarily
in his direction, and instinctively they would pause in their
conversation to allow their visitors an opportunity of expressing
their admiration, and their amazement, over “<em>Such</em> a
fine little fellow! Such a <em>huge</em> child!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our Njo” looked perfectly charming to-day. Mamma
had brushed the pretty brown curls herself, to do him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>justice in the eyes of her husband’s relations; and it was
with his most roguish expression, and his usual winning
manner, that he held up his little face with a merry laugh
for the new aunt to kiss. And Aunt said nothing but “How
d’ye do, Njo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Max glanced at his wife; but she replied by a sign which
was meant to convey some such remark: “You can’t blame
her for it; she doesn’t understand children,” and that
checked Max’s rising resentment.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this time the poor hostess was sitting very ill at ease;
she kept up the conversation for a few minutes, and then
asked if her cousin would not like to be shown to her room.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mrs Martendijk preferred to drink a glass of port
first, so Jo had to remain sitting in the <em>kabaja</em> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sarong</span></i>,
which seemed to her more soiled and faded every moment.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>II.</h3>

<p class='c021'>It was doubly annoying to the dainty little hostess to be
surprised in such slovenly attire, because this was her first
introduction to the Martendijks, and she had set her heart
on making a good impression on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though Emily and Johanna now met for the first time,
their husbands were cousins and old acquaintances. Van
Elst had been under some obligation to Martendijk’s
father; and although he had not much in common with his
cousin, he had always remained on friendly terms with him,
in acknowledgment of his uncle’s past kindness.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had both gone abroad at the same time, and after
the lapse of ten years they thus met again, both married—the
one managing partner in a sugar factory, the other
notary in a prosperous place in the eastern province of
Java.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no resemblance, not even a trace of family
likeness, between the cousins.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Max was a strongly built man of middle height, broad-shouldered,
and remarkably robust, with clear blue eyes,
fresh colour, a full beard, and a laughing mouth; while
Piet Martendijk was one of those long lean men whose
appearance suggests that they have not been over fed
in their young days, with scanty whiskers and hair, a long
neck, and alarmingly thin legs; his complexion was sallow,
his eyes lack-lustre, and his lips without a smile, which
made some ladies pronounce him interesting, others distinguished,
and men declare it a sin that he should have
such a fine-looking wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>She <em>was</em> a good-looking woman, with her handsome and
graceful figure, her regular features, her luxuriant mass of
dark hair, and her tasteful dress. But, after a few days’
acquaintance, one found oneself wondering curiously if
there was nothing could call forth a change in the expression
of her eyes,—so cool was their gaze, and so indifferent,
that a warm heart involuntarily shrank before them. Impassive
faces of that sort have sometimes a certain fascination,—one
is ready to imagine that the well-controlled
features mask some deeply hidden sorrow, some tragic
secret, that there is warm blood in the pale cheeks, and
a passionate heart beating in the seemingly placid bosom.
But Mrs Martendijk’s whole personality was so insignificant,
her talk so trifling, and her smile so cold, that it would
have been difficult for the most romantically inclined to find
her interesting; and for the Van Elsts it was absolutely
impossible, as they knew her whole history.</p>

<p class='c009'>A most commonplace one it was. The eldest daughter
of a man who had made his money in the cheese trade,
she had known Martendijk for years without thinking of a
tenderer relationship, and had got engaged to him by correspondence,
after he had been some time in the Indies, and
the idea suddenly occurred to him of winning her as his wife.
As soon as the old cheesemonger had made satisfactory
inquiries into the prospects of the sugar trade, all arrangements
had been completed by letter, and she had “come
out.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>It was a childless marriage. Both professed themselves
highly satisfied with this state of matters,—an assertion

grapes, but which might gain credence in this case considering
the peculiar tastes and dispositions of the couple.</p>

pretty little face, Mrs Van Elst stood in the verandah awaiting
her guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the self-complacency of an active housewife she let
her eye rove over the tempting table, to the sideboard with
its sparkling crystal, and to the side-table where the dishes
stood ready to be handed round. “What a shame to let
everything get cold,” she said to herself, greeting Max as he
entered with the query if the “boy” had not announced
luncheon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and I have called them myself too,” says Max, a
little crossly, for he loves to have the curry served hot, “but
they don’t seem to be ready yet. How splendid it looks,”
he continues, and, with a furtive glance round to make sure
that the children are out of the way, he helps himself from
one of the dishes to a leg of roast fowl. He has abundant
time to pick the bone leisurely before the guests appear,
with the immediate request from Emily that the door may
be closed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, cousin,” Max exclaims, “it will be so frightfully
stuffy here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but there’s such a draught just now; and that’s so
dangerous for Piet’s complaint, you see. So—if you don’t
mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They seat themselves, and the “boys” begin to wait. Jo
is glad to see that the cook has exerted herself to the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>utmost, and throws a contented little nod across to her
husband, as much as to say, “Now, haven’t you a clever
little wife?” to which he replies convincingly by helping
himself very liberally from the various dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once Jo discovers that Cousin Martendijk is eating
away at <em>dry rice</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you have some curry?” she asks; “or perhaps
you would rather——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you, cousin, I often eat my rice dry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do have a little piece of fricassee, then!” she exclaims
in dismay, as he lets even that indispensable dish pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it’s so dangerous to eat fricassee. You never know
what it’s made of. And when one is a martyr to indigestion——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come,” Max exclaims impatiently, “you don’t need
to be afraid of anything of that kind here. Jo always makes
the fricassee herself, and most delicious it is, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, a small piece then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Martendijk ate very little also; and Jo could not
help noticing how Cousin Martendijk, who was rather shortsighted,
gave a disdainful sniff every now and then at one
or other of the dishes, and how his wife, without even
honouring them with a glance, sent away one after another
with a brief but decisive “<em>tida</em>.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>My gentle readers will admit that this was a very trying
experience for a hostess. Jo begins all at once to doubt her
own domestic capabilities, and the painful conviction grows
upon her that the fowl must be very tough, and the fish not
fresh, and that there is a want of variety. A sort of dumb
rage at the cook gradually takes possession of her,—she has
such a trick of making the <em>sambalans</em> too hot; and she casts
a vindictive glance at the “boy” when he forgets to hand
round the pickles. And when the pickles are likewise smelt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>and examined, and declined, she feels her face blaze, and
her appetite vanish, and a wild longing comes over her for
the moment when she can give the signal to rise from
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear cousin,” began Emily the next morning, following
Jo into the store-room, where she was busy giving out
provisions, “I think you were rather hurt at our eating so
little yesterday, were you not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, to tell the truth——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now then, to put it all right, I’ll just tell you what was
the real reason. You use cocoa-nut oil, don’t you? and you
don’t make it at home! I tasted that at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, that is true; the cook has enough to do as it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my dear! don’t you pay any attention to a cook
like that. They can easily get through all their work. And
do you know why Piet ate so little? Everything was too
strong for him. I’m just telling you, you know, so that you
may manage things better another time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but that won’t be so very easy,” Jo ventured,
“because—well, you see, my husband likes his food very
highly seasoned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That <em>is</em> a pity. But,” continued Emily, with an amiable
little laugh, “I know what you can do. Have some <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">sambal</span></i><a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
made separately for him, and he can mix it with his food.
We must adapt ourselves to one another, must we not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, certainly,” said Jo, “if there happens to be anything
else you don’t care for, or that is bad for Cousin Martendijk’s
inside——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, thank you! We had a delicious dinner yesterday
evening. Your cook is a capital hand. Oh, wait a
moment, though, I had nearly forgotten. My good man is
accustomed to have a cup of <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bouillon</span></i> about eleven o’clock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>and I a cup of chocolate—but it must be <em>chicken</em>-broth; he
is not allowed beef-tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” said Jo, a vision immediately rising before
her of the wrath of her cook when told that not only was
she expected to make the cocoa-nut oil herself, but to prepare
<em>kaldoe</em><a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a> and chocolate at the very busiest hour of the
morning. It was enough to make her give notice on the
spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Van Elst, to tell the truth, stood in considerable
awe of this cook, who was highly proficient in her art, used
little butter, and did not appropriate much of the marketing
money; and, I appeal to you, what mistress would not
tremble at the thought of losing such a treasure?</p>

<p class='c009'>She paved the way, therefore, with some friendly remarks,
and even went the length of promising a new <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sarong</span></i> before
she broached <em>the</em> subject; and flattered herself that all was
going to end smoothly, when cook all at once snatched up
a basket of potatoes with one vicious jerk, and with another
laid hold of the rice, and closed the door of the store-room
behind her with a bang that thrilled her mistress from head
to foot. Jo knew what to expect.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the rest, Emily supplied a ready answer to the great
question which haunts Indian no less than Dutch housewives:
what are we to have for dinner to-day? It was
virtually she who proposed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menu</span></i> every day. “Do you
know what I’d make to-day?” she would remark to Jo;—“one
of those dishes of macaroni, with ham and cheese.”
Or, “If you want to give Martendijk a treat, dear cousin,
give him asparagus, he’s wild about that.” Or, “Do you
never make tarts, Jo?—You do?—Well, I have a delicious
recipe for one I can lend you if you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was really very kind of Emily, Jo thought; and she
had little more cause to complain of her guest’s want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>appetite, especially as Mrs Martendijk had taken upon herself
to make sure that nothing came to table which might
prove injurious to her husband’s digestion.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>III.</h3>

<p class='c021'>Visiting is more of a burden than a pleasure in Holland,
where people are confined within such narrow limits, and
where the usual routine of daily life must be gone on with
as usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Dutch host may express the hope that you will
“make yourself quite at home,” adding that you are perfectly
free to do what you like; but when bedtime comes, he also
informs you that they breakfast at eight sharp, and his wife
asks you in the sweetest manner possible to be so good as
not to keep the light burning; and both are rather hurt if
you do not evince any great anxiety to cultivate the acquaintance
of all their friends, and think it rather “strange” if
you go out on your own account.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only in the Indies can one “make one’s self quite at
home,” and that undoubtedly accounts for the interchange of
visits being so much more common there than with us, and
for people who are barely acquainted beforehand finding it
possible to stay weeks and even months with one another
without inconvenience to host or guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even in the Indies, however, much depends on whether
or not the visitors are located in a detached part of the
house. This is an arrangement which commends itself
especially to those who have children with them. There
are so many details to be attended to, and arrangements
made in that case, that the close proximity to
strangers is a little awkward, and the visitor has rather an
anxious time of it in Holland. Every mother knows the
haunting dread lest the baby should take it into its head to
indulge in a prolonged fit of screaming in the middle of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>host’s mid-day nap, and she is painfully aware that childish
freaks and misdemeanours may not always meet with sympathy
in their new surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in the Indies these fears and worries are unknown.
The children are quartered in the detached part of the
house, where they may romp and scream to their hearts’
content; and there is no risk of interference if punishment is
required, nor need to blush for shame at one’s powerlessness
under the rule of a spoilt four-year-old tyrant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Others, besides happy parents, have reason to be grateful
for the Indian arrangement,—the young man with his late
hours, the young lady with her delicate little traffic in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets-doux</span></i>
and bouquets, for instance. And it commends itself
highly to many a young couple, when the husband takes a
fancy to revive the days of courtship, or the young wife has
set her heart on a charming blue dress in the bazaar,—so
cheap, and blue is just the colour he likes her best in,—and
so on. (We all know the sort of talk that goes on, and how
it ends.) And should it happen—for such things <em>do</em> occur—that
they have a slight disagreement, and the tender
husband’s tone waxes warm, and his sweet little wife has
recourse to tears,—well, the courtyard is wide, and the host
and hostess are totally unaware of any disturbance; so, presently
they trip into the verandah as staid and as charming
as if they never heard of “spooning,” not to speak of squabbling.
It is not at all unlikely that the host himself may
have profited by their absence, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour laver son linge sale en
famille</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Van Elsts had a very nice visitors’ room detached
from the rest of the house, with a verandah opening on a
pretty flower-garden. Jo was in the habit of having her
visitors’ breakfast set in this front verandah, chiefly because
she liked to devote the morning undisturbed to her husband
and children, and because, moreover, it was more convenient
for all domestic arrangements.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>But the very first morning after their arrival, Emily came,
laughing, to say that they thought it would be so much more
sociable to breakfast altogether, especially as Piet fancied it
was a little damp over the way, and he had to guard carefully
against damp on account of his complaint.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Van Elsts thought it charming of their guests to be
so sociably inclined, but it was a little awkward nevertheless;
and Jo wondered, with some surprise, how Emily did not
understand that, though it might be pleasanter for herself,
it might be decidedly inconvenient for the mother of three
children to have her visitors about her so early.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo had a great deal to do in the mornings, like all Indian
ladies, though Dutch housewives, we know, are inclined to
be sceptical on that point. The children had to be bathed,—an
operation she liked to superintend in person,—the
clothes to be looked over, the washing and sewing given
out, the dinner ordered, and the thousand and one little
domestic duties attended to; it was generally eleven o’clock
before she was ready to sit down quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was, of course, more than usual to do with the
Martendijks in the house, but Jo was ready at last, and
having just about an hour to spare, she was anxious to finish
the little frock over which she had been busy for some time,
and which was only waiting for the buttons and trimming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope I’m not intruding, Cousin Jo?” said a suave
voice, and Emily came in, and continued, regardless of the
frock Jo held in her hand, “Look here! I have a skirt
which doesn’t hang well; do you think you can see what’s
the matter with it? I hear you are so neat-handed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo laid the little frock aside with a sigh, and began with
deft fingers to examine the drapery. The fault was soon
detected. The skirt must be unpicked, the folds relaid and
pinned down; and in the middle of this process, Emily
suggested sweetly that it was more than time Piet had his
broth. Jo ran off with all speed to the kitchen, where cook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>received her with a withering glance, and when her mistress
asked for the <em>kaldoe</em>, assumed an air of dense stupidity
which checked all further inquiry. Only by dint of lifting
one lid after another did Mrs Van Elst at length discover a
fowl floating in tepid water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo was not accustomed to yield,—not even to her invaluable
cook,—nor had she forgotten how to work in the
Indies; so, soon she had the <em>kaldoe</em> simmering over a
moderate fire, and the chocolate all ready save the boiling
water. But to procure boiling water seemed to require
some magic quite beyond the powers of an ordinary cook;
an immense kettle, full to the brim, was suspended over a
low fire, the wood was apparently damp, the kitchen full
of smoke, and not a single clean saucepan was to be
found.... When Mrs Van Elst at last carried in the two
cups, it certainly was not only the heat which flushed her
cheeks and made her hands tremble!</p>

<p class='c009'>Emily did not seem to notice her agitation; she thanked
her cousin quite cordially for the trouble she had taken,
evidently found the fragrant chocolate very much to her
liking, tasted the <em>kaldoe</em> critically, and when Jo expressed
the fear that it was not strong enough, she smiled good-naturedly,
and had no doubt it would be better to-morrow!</p>

<p class='c009'>Her next proceeding was to beg Jo to try on the altered
skirt, so that she could judge better of the draping, and
the time was spent in pinning and laying folds till the
“boy” came to announce dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo laid away the unfinished frock, hoping that perhaps
to-morrow she might make up for lost time. But next
morning Emily proposed a visit to the Chinese quarter, if
her cousin would be so good as go with her,—she had some
shopping to do. And the third morning, just as Jo had
once more produced her work, Emily, who was sociably
inclined, and did not care to be alone, came to beg her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>cousin to be so very kind as to explain to her how that
lovely collar was made that she had on yesterday.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, certainly! Jo would tell her,—so much embroidery,
and lace, and.... “Wait a minute!” cried Emily; “I’ll
just fetch what we need, and you can help me; you are so
clever at these things—much cleverer than I am! This is
a splendid chance, Jo, for me to go over my wardrobe; it
is so much cheaper to do up things one’s self than to be
always going to a milliner or dressmaker—and you <em>will</em>
help me, won’t you?”</p>

<h3 class='c020'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c021'>“Just listen to this!” exclaimed Van Elst, reading the
foreign telegrams at the tea-table that afternoon. “Russia
has declared war against Turkey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed!” remarked Martendijk indifferently. “Well,
I thought it would come to that in the end.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s really terrible,” Max went on. “How many wars
does that make within our recollection? And in our
much-vaunted nineteenth century too! I hoped they
would have been able to avert this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have your people Turkish or Russian bonds?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; why on earth should you think that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, because you are so interested in that war. You
would be in a bad way in that case. It is great folly. We
don’t have anything to do with that sort of thing either—do
we, Emily?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed,” said Emily. “As far as we are concerned,
all Europe can go to war.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alas!” cried Jo, who had not been listening to this
dialogue between the couple. “What terrible news, Max!
To think of the waste of strong young lives, and all the
wives and mothers who are left at home.” And instinctively
she drew little Jan towards her, and pressed him close.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>“Well, there’s no danger for <em>him</em> in the meantime,” said
Martendijk; and Mr and Mrs Van Elst glanced at one
another, as they had so often done during the past few days,
as if to ask what manner of people these cousins could be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Martendijk was also glancing through a newspaper,
and, suddenly turning to her husband, she exclaimed,
“What did I prophesy, Piet? Van Dalem is in the
bankruptcy court.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well!” said Piet. “After all, what else was to be
expected. It’s the last straw breaks the camel’s back! It
is the man’s own fault. You must understand, Max,” he
continued, addressing his cousin, “this Van Dalem was a
near neighbour of ours. He came into a splendid business,
and might have been rolling in wealth in a few years; but
you never saw such a spendthrift. He was always thrusting
himself forward, always entertaining, always having
visitors——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” affirmed Emily; “and the worst of it was, while
his wife was giving parties, he was lending money right and
left,—standing security, advancing money to every beggar
who came to him; he said he could not refuse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Real good-natured folk, then?” asked Van Elst.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, good-natured enough as far as that went. I
can’t tell you how many widows he has given shelter to,
how many little waifs she took in from the native village
(they have no children of their own), how many forced
sales he has put a stop to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow,” cried Max, “I wish I could do something
for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s easy to say that, Max,” interposed Martendijk;
“but,” and he pulled his thin whiskers meditatively, “it
comes to be a question if it is right to sympathise with
people of that kind. Is it not their own fault that they
have gone down in the world? Is it not inexcusable to run
through one’s money in that way?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>“Inexcusable? I don’t agree with you there. At least
he has run through it in a way which speaks well for his
heart, if not for his good sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am anxious to see if people will help him in his turn,”
said Emily, in a tone which irritated Van Elst beyond
measure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course they will,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think so?” asked Martendijk, with some expression
for once in his weak face. “People are, as a
rule, more ready to look you up when they need you than
when you need them. He certainly had a great many
friends; but we know what that amounts to. In any case,”
he continued after a pause, “it is safest to make sure that
you will never be dependent on any one’s help.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is true,” said Max. But as he spoke he left his
seat abruptly, and went to have a look at the flowers with
little Jan. Jo very soon followed him. It was very evident
that he had lost his temper; and she was always ready in
such an emergency to do her best to drive away the clouds
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! nothing. Rather disgusted; that’s all. How do
you like the Martendijks, Jo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! not particularly. Perhaps it would be better to
suspend our judgment of them for a little, Max.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see it,” said Max, sharply. “But, Jo, do you
know what we might do?” he added, hastily, seeing her
shrink at his vehemence, “go for a drive just now; then Jan
can go too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! yes, papa,” cried Jan, delightfully, “and sit on the
box.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, the horses have been too far to-day already.
Emily drove to the Chinese camp, and was out for more
than two hours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Indeed!</em>” said Max. “Well, then, for goodness’ sake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>let us stop at home. That will be very nice too, won’t it,
Jan? and we’ll build a fortress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo was satisfied that the clouds were fast dispersing;
she took her husband’s arm, and exerted herself to be
specially bright and charming, chattering to him about the
children, and all sorts of interesting things, and finally
assisting at his toilet,—a favour he particularly enjoyed,—and
prattling all manner of pretty compliments to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Max was in high good-humour when he left her to go for
a turn with Jan.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Jo appeared, after a hasty toilet, she found their
cousins in the verandah before her, busy with the illustrated
papers.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was a most innocent pastime certainly; but, alas!
Martendijk had taken possession of Max’s place and chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Mrs Van Elst was the most accommodating little
person imaginable, and would have given up <em>her</em> chair to
any one in the world; but she was quite different where
<em>Max</em> was concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! there’s my husband coming,” she exclaimed in a
minute or two, as he came up the drive with Jan; and as
Martendijk showed not the slightest disposition to take the
hint, she added, as pleasantly as she could, “Martendijk,
I’m sure you are not aware that that is Max’s place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear cousin,” said Martendijk, stretching himself
with an air of contentment. “To tell you the truth, I
was quite aware of the fact; but Emily chose this place
for me, because there are such draughts everywhere else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I am sure Cousin Max will be glad to give up
his place to you for a little,—won’t you, Max?” Emily
struck in.</p>

<p class='c009'>To Jo’s relief, her husband assented, and Martendijk
made himself as comfortable as he could in his host’s
chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The children came in from their walk, and stayed as usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>with papa and mamma till bedtime,—a habit as pleasant for
parents as for guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>They formed a pretty group, the three innocent child-heads,
and at the sight Max’s and Jo’s beaming eyes met,
and at last the happy little wife could not refrain from the
question,—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you two think our children are little angels?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, darlings!” responded Emily. “So good and sweet-tempered;
especially little Jan, he doesn’t give you much
trouble now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Trouble!</em>” exclaimed Jo. “Oh! not one of them gives
any trouble,—only a very little when they are ill. But as
long as they keep well I have nothing but pleasure in
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she spoke the truth, for all cares and anxieties were
light to her, because so willingly borne.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d not mind having a boy like this, about three or
four,” Emily continued, drawing little Jan to her caressingly;
“but a baby like <em>that</em>” (with a glance at “charming
little Ada”) “I consider <em>horrible</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Horrible!</em>” Jo shrank from her in dismay, indignant
that any one should speak so. But her anger was transient,
for she immediately remembered that it was not poor Emily’s
fault that she had such strange ideas; she really did not
know what it was to have children of her own.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>V.</h3>

<p class='c021'>The Martendijks had been about three weeks with the
Van Elsts, when the solitary bachelor over the way began to
observe some change in his neighbours.</p>

<p class='c009'>The notary began to go earlier to his office, and to come
home later. The little wife, of whom he was growing rather
fond by dint of watching her so long, did not take her walks
so regularly; and when she played with the children in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>garden in the morning, her laugh sounded less merry than
it once did. When the old gentleman (who seemed to
have assumed this privilege of observing his neighbours
with special interest because it <em>might have been</em> his lot to
have just such another family) noticed that Mr Van Elst
looked cross, and his wife very wearied, he began to grow
uneasy, and at last set on foot inquiries through the medium
of his own “boys” and those of his neighbours, which
resulted in the reassuring news that no one was ill. After
that the old bachelor did not know what to make of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet the explanation was simple enough!</p>

<p class='c009'>To be ousted from your favourite seat, to have tasteless
food set before you, to see your delicate wife tired to death,
your horses over-driven, your store-room plundered, all this
is very easy to bear,—nay, may even be reckoned among
the pleasures of hospitality, if your visitors are agreeable
people, whose society compensates for the lack of the
usual cosy <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>, and whose cordial interest in all your
concerns proves that they like you and appreciate the
friendship you show them. But, when you see that your
guests regard you merely as convenient people to spend
some time with,—that they take advantage of your hospitality,
and honour you with no special cordiality in return,—when
they remind you, by their treatment, of certain
fruits you throw away once the juice is squeezed out, it
is impossible to submit to the visitation with a very good
grace!</p>

<p class='c009'>That certainly was the case here.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Elst, moreover, with his warm temperament and
strength of character, could ill brook his cold-blooded
cousin. He liked men to be firm, and women tender-hearted;
and Piet was so weak, and Emily so cold, and
the two couples so directly opposed to each other in all
their sentiments and opinions, that the most innocent
conversations often led to collision. When, for example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Van Elst brought home the news one day that one of their
acquaintances had been suddenly taken ill, and Jo asked,
with a quaver in her voice and tears in her eyes, if she
could do anything to help the poor wife, Emily scarcely
listened, and Piet only to inquire anxiously what was the
matter—he hoped nothing infectious!</p>

<p class='c009'>With regard to society, there was great diversity of opinion
between the couples. Up country in the Indies it is possible
to live on such terms with all the Europeans as to
avoid giving offence, while at the same time one cannot
be intimate with all. One comes across many people there
who are wealthy, who entertain, and are to a certain
extent admitted into society, but of so low a stamp intellectually
and morally that it is impossible for respectable
families to associate familiarly with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Van Elsts had thus soon chosen their own friends,
and to this select circle they had introduced their guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Martendijks struck up acquaintance with a family
with whom they had no wish to become intimate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good gracious!” said Max, who did not approve of
this at all; “what is there in that man to take your fancy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much,” replied Martendijk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely his wife isn’t the attraction, then?—a stupid
insignificant creature like that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she is very stupid,” said Martendijk. “But she
is a capital cook,” he added, after a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, but they’re not people to get so very intimate
with. Perhaps you don’t know that he has a very shady
reputation,—it is well known that he got that factory into
his hands by a very dirty trick. They say he made the
former owner drunk, and then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s very likely true,” interposed Martendijk coolly;
“he looks to me just that sort of man. But that does not
prevent his keeping capital wine, and being very generous
with his help——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>“For any sake hold your tongue!” cried Max, suddenly
turning his back on his guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the most violent explosion took place one morning
at the breakfast-table, when the conversation turned upon
one of their aunts—a sister of Martendijk’s father and
Max’s mother—who was in great poverty, and had been very
unfortunate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not troubled my head about her for years,” said
Piet. “I may tell you I make a point of interesting myself
only in my respectable relatives.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean in those who have got on well in the world,”
observed Max. “Aunt Liza is a worthy respectable woman,
whose only fault is her poverty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she had no position at all in Delft,” said Emily.
(Martendijk was silent: he preferred not to argue with his
cousin when Max’s eyes flashed like that.) “She dealt in
tea, I think, or knitting-cotton, or something of that kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, just so, in <em>tea</em>,” said Max; “exactly in the same
way as your husband deals in sugar, and your father in
cheese. Good-morning!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good gracious, Jo, what a temper your husband is in!”
exclaimed Emily, who was determined not to take offence,
because she was very comfortable with Martendijk’s relatives,
and the building at their own place at Soeka-Manies—the
real reason for their visiting—was still going on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Martendijk, the courage of his opinions
returning as soon as he heard Max drive away; “I don’t
see why on earth he should get so excited!”</p>

<p class='c009'>What surprised the Van Elsts more than anything else,
was the relation of the couple to one another. The same
man and woman, who had not one grain of sympathy for the
troubles of others, or for the most terrible national calamity,
and who were totally impervious to the sufferings of even
their friends and relations, were full of devotion to one
another.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>If Piet was not quite the thing, Emily was full of anxiety;
and if she looked worried, Piet did his best to conquer his
despondency. In short, disagreeable though they were in
every other respect, they were a model couple. It was difficult
for a third person to start any subject of conversation
with them, because nothing interested them which did not
affect themselves directly or indirectly; but they were never
at a loss for a subject when by themselves, and their conversation
was inexhaustible so long as they could devote
themselves unreservedly to the discussion of their own
affairs, bringing every effort of mind to bear on what concerned
them alone.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Money</em> was a favourite topic: how they could enjoy this
or that together—it was always together!—without much
expense; how to manage their domestic expenditure most
satisfactorily; how to invest a small sum securely—and
so on.</p>

<p class='c009'>They spent so long over these interesting details, that it
was impossible for outsiders to take any part in their discussions.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c021'>“Just look here a minute, Max; is it my fancy, or does
Jan look a little pale to-day?” asked Mrs Van Elst one
morning, as she went out to the verandah to see her husband
off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it is your fancy,” said Max, who made a point
of never allowing that any of the children were ill,—a device
intended to calm their nervous mother, but which always
had precisely the contrary effect “Come here a moment,
Njo; your mother says you’re not well. Come, my boy, tell
me what’s the matter with you,” he added less carelessly,
as Jan, usually anything but slow to respond to his father’s
call, dragged himself listlessly towards them, and sank
down upon a chair.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>“Not comf’ble, papa—headache!” was all he vouchsafed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Max took him on his knee, and glanced at his wife. Yes,
the old story; she was pale, her lips trembled, and her eyes
were bent tenderly and anxiously on the child. It was this
readiness to take alarm which caused Jo more suffering than
the patient, whenever her husband or children were ailing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we just send for the doctor, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; did I ever!” cried Max. “The man would think
we were mad. Because Njo has a little headache, forsooth!
Come, my boy, go and play.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Play!</em> Good gracious! Max, just feel how hot his
head is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, put him to bed then. You can do that at least,”
and he laughed, as it seemed to her, heartlessly, and called
her “a silly thing”—a jocular remark which was met by none
of Jo’s usual repartees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa must come too,” was Jan’s command, and we know
that no general is better obeyed by his soldiers than a sick
child by its parents. So Max carried his boy first over one
shoulder, then over the other, after which he had to creep
on all fours round the room, roaring like a lion, before Njo
would be laid down. The patient was not particularly disposed
to go to sleep; he allowed papa to coddle him, and
mamma to bring him lemonade, and did as many children do
when much notice is taken of their ailments—made himself
out much worse than he really was.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it was really impossible for his father to remain
longer, he coaxed and whimpered a little, and finally cried
himself to sleep, so that Jo was free to enjoy a quiet hour by
his bedside with her work-basket, for every available moment
must be snatched to make up for the time lost through
Emily’s visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their visitors had gone out very early that morning to call
on one of their new acquaintances, a sugar manufacturer like
Martendijk. It was so pleasant to come across some one in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>your own line, he remarked; they could discuss one thing
and another while driving or walking together, and one got
many a hint and idea in that way.</p>

<p class='c009'>On their return home, the “boy” told them “Sinjo Jan”
was ill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear! that’s always the worst of visiting where there
are children,” said Martendijk, as he sipped his <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bouillon</span></i>;
“there’s always something wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, this would not be much to speak of,” said Emily,
“only I’m afraid it may interfere with to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be explained that the Martendijks had talked so
much about the attention shown to them on all sides as the
Van Elsts’ guests (and they certainly had not been slow to
avail themselves of the social advantages of the neighbourhood),
that Jo felt at last obliged to give a small party in
acknowledgment of the courtesy shown to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her guests need never know all it had cost her to
talk Max over, and how, when one argument after another
failed to win over her perverse lord and master, she had at
last taken refuge in that weapon which loses its power when
too often used, and is the very last resort therefore of a
clever woman—I mean tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>For, though Jo would hardly admit the fact even to herself,
Max had not been just altogether pleasant to deal with
of late,—indeed, he had really been quite disagreeable and
cross, and very unwilling to acknowledge himself in the
wrong.</p>

<p class='c009'>His liver had been bothering him for some little time (no
wonder he grumbled), and Jo, only too ready to find satisfactory
excuses for his ill-temper, was glad enough to reiterate
constantly to her visitors, who had also a good deal to stand
from his bearish ways, how the liver affects the temper, and
how wretched it makes one feel.</p>

<p class='c009'>This did not prevent their cousins from assuring one
another repeatedly, once they were safe in their own room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>that Max was a disagreeable fellow, and that were it not
for the comfortable quarters they were in, and the building
going on at home, they would remain no longer. For so
wrapt up were they in themselves and in one another, and
so absorbing was their <em>egoïsme à deux</em>, that it was impossible
for them to realise how actions and remarks like theirs
affected others; therefore, of course, they blamed Cousin
Max for the rather strained relations which had come about.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as she had drunk her chocolate, Emily betook
herself to the nursery to see what were the prospects for the
party.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, dear cousin,” she began, making no attempt to
lower her somewhat harsh voice, “what is this I hear? Is
little Jan ill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very much afraid he is,” said Jo; “he is so restless
in his sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little feverish, perhaps,” said Emily, taking the child’s
hand in her own for a moment. “I’d give him a good dose
of quinine,” she continued, “and he’ll be all right by to-morrow
evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why to-morrow evening,” asked Jo, puzzled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I ever! Have you forgotten all about that?
Why, it was to-morrow evening we were to have that
party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me, so it was,” cried Jo. “I’d nearly forgotten
all about it. But, of course, if he is ill it will have to be
put off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, of course,” said Emily, “if he is ill. But it’s
surely nothing serious. You always get frightened so
quickly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do, it is true; and it really can’t be anything.
But oh, Emily, he is such an angel, my Njo! and you always
see that particularly sweet children don’t live long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wet eyelashes and quivering lips were not without
their effect even on cold Mrs Martendijk.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>“Well, well,” she said kindly, “I would not worry about
that. Jan has his naughty fits just like other boys; and
besides, if all the children were to die whose mothers consider
them ‘almost <em>too</em> good’ for this world, there would
not be many left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Seeing how nervous Jo got, and how the event generally
proved her fears groundless, Max was always making resolutions
not to yield to such exaggerated anxiety another time.
So when he came home at mid-day and found his wife still
occupied with the child, he coolly carried her off to another
room, and gently but firmly forbade her to leave it until she
had rested for a few hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo was too tired to resist, and soon fell asleep. She did
not awake till late in the afternoon, for which she could not
forgive herself, though it was, in fact, the best thing that
could have happened, considering the disturbed night she
was to have. It did not need much persuasion to induce
Max to send for the doctor next morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Emily took care to be in the verandah when he stopped
to say a few words to Mrs Van Elst after his visit to the
little patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s not much the matter is there, doctor?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—at least I think not,” was his reply. “It’s not
easy to predict in a case of illness, but, as far as appearances
go, it seems to me an ordinary cold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, you see, Jo, what did we all tell you? You do
get anxious so soon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you see, I have so much to lose,” said Jo deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it gives you any pleasure to worry,” said the doctor,
“you had better do so about yourself, and not about that
sturdy little chap,”—and with a compassionate glance at the
young wife, who had already been so often a patient of his,
he took her hand in his own. “You’re not looking so well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>as you did, Mrs Van Elst,” he said. “You wear yourself
out, and don’t do enough to get up your strength. I shall
have to scold in good earnest—or speak to Van Elst.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, for goodness’ sake, don’t do that!” exclaimed
Jo, glad that Max was safe in his office. “How angry he
would be!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Jo,” said her guest, when the doctor had gone,
“that <em>is</em> a relief. An ordinary cold, it will be better in
a day or two. Now let us set to work to get ready for the
party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear Emily, what do you think? Shall we not
rather put it off?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put it off? and why? Come, Jo, what’s the matter
with you? All the invitations are out already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to have it for your sake,” Jo began again;
“you know that, don’t you? But I am <em>so</em> tired! I never
closed an eye last night; and there is so much to be done—baking,
and all that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Emily, “surely your maid can help you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Siah? Oh, no; she must stay with Njo—she’s his old
‘baboe.’<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a> No, really, it can’t be managed. Oh, if you
only knew how dead tired I am!” and the poor little woman
sank into a chair, and closed her eyes as if to shut out the
mountain of work that the mere thought of the party conjured
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If <em>I</em> undertook all the trouble,” asked Emily, after a
moment’s reflection, “could we go on with it then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes,” said Jo, “if you would be so very good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was too much absorbed in her sick child to trouble
herself much about the success of the party, else she would
have been decidedly uneasy; for it had gradually dawned
upon her that Emily did not know much of the noble art of
cookery. Notwithstanding her great readiness to recommend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>dishes and to lend recipes, she had never yet concocted
anything herself; and even when Jo had begged her
to help with a few domestic duties on specially busy days,
she had always tried to get out of it. To-day it was quite
different, however.</p>

<p class='c009'>She asked for the keys, and in ten minutes had all the
“boys” and maids hard at work; while she herself was
here, there, and everywhere, thinking of everything,—making
cakes, planning the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menu</span></i>, and all with a deftness and briskness
which were quite enviable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dear!” thought Jo, when she saw her cousin’s
activity, “if she had only helped me like that sooner, how
much nicer it would have been having visitors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jo arranged the flowers; Martendijk the card-tables;
Emily superintended the supper; and by mid-day everything
was ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>Emily went to take a nap, while her hostess did the same,
so as to be bright and fresh when the evening came.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so probably she would have been, after a quiet undisturbed
sleep; but the little patient grew worse about the
middle of the day; and when his father came home, he saw
at once that the child was feverish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear Max,” sighed Jo, “what a worry! A sick
child, and that party in the evening!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Party!</em>” cried Max, to his wife’s great consternation.
“It’s out of the question. Did you think I’d ever allow
that? Certainly not. What a mad idea to think of having
people here to-night! Emily’s at the bottom of that, I’ll be
bound.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed, dear. I was quite anxious for it too,”
pleaded Jo, shielding her guest at the expense of her own
truthfulness. “And oh, Max, Emily has been so good;
she arranged everything, and I have had nothing at all
to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course she helps you now, as it’s her party, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>is bent on having her own way,—but I’ll soon see who is
master in my house. The party will <em>not</em> go on, I tell you.
I’ll have the people put off. Where are the boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Elst had spoken so loud in his passionate outburst,
that it needed no eavesdropping to find out his intentions;
and perhaps that was the reason that Emily appeared so
opportunely just then.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! excuse me, cousin,” he exclaimed apologetically,
running against her in his hurry. “Do you know where the
boys are?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are round at the back,” said Mrs Martendijk,
looking brighter and livelier than he had ever seen her.
“Look here, cousin,” and she took his arm confidentially
to lead him to the back verandah, “have we not worked
well to-day? Everything is ready——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the party can——” began Max.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And should you like to see what you’re going to have
to-night?” And in the same friendly manner he was conducted
to the pantry. “Just look at that magnificent trifle.
And are not the tarts a success? But the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâtés</span></i> are <em>the</em>
thing. They look just as if they came straight from the
best confectioner’s—do they not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am really sorry you have had so much trouble, and I
must say it all looks beautiful; but the party cannot possibly
go on,” repeated Max, firmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; it’s a great pity, and I can understand how annoyed
you feel; but Jan is decidedly worse....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Emily had recovered her composure by this time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jan worse! My word! I had no idea of that,” she
cried. “Gracious! cousin, if I had known that an hour
sooner; and now the punch is made!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now Max’s turn to be disconcerted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it was time it was done, you see;” and Emily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>seated herself. “One would really need to know everything
beforehand,” she went on, coolly; “then we should at least
not have opened those fine wines and the expensive champagne.
The supper will cost a great deal too, to be sure,
and the money’s all thrown away now; but we can eat everything
some time or other among ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">punch</span></i> won’t keep, I suppose?” asked Max.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh no! it <em>is</em> a pity Jan is so ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he’s not so very much worse!” exclaimed Max
impatiently. “But what a wretched amount of stuff,” he
added, after a moment, when he had made a rapid mental
calculation of the needless expense, and realised how odious
it would be to see Piet and Emily devouring all the dainties.
“If only Jo was not so very tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; it would be very unfortunate if she were not able
to appear. But we can always see how Jan is; and if she
were to decide at the last moment to stay with the child,—well,
I’d be glad to do the honours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For goodness’ sake let it be, then,” said Max; and as
his guest made her escape as fast as she could, without prejudice
to her dignity, he sent a wish after her which was
more expressive than courteous.</p>

<p class='c009'>Emily only enjoyed a little laugh at his helpless fury,
congratulating herself on the success of her diplomacy,
for on hearing about half-an-hour before that the child was
worse, she had given orders to have the punch mixed; and
when she stepped into the store-room, she was met with a
request from Piet, who had been told off to superintend, to
taste and see if the ingredients were right.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c021'>Jo did <em>not</em> appear that evening. Jan complained of sore
throat; and the mother, in her dread of diphtheria, sent for
the doctor at once, and remained at the child’s bedside, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>spite of his assurances that nothing was the matter. Emily
did the honours, and appeared to enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though each of the guests had privately resolved not to
stay late for the little boy’s sake, it was two o’clock before
the last had departed, and three before the house was quiet.
Indeed absolute quiet there never was that whole night, for
Jo, as she lay awake, heard first all sorts of unaccountable
sounds proceeding from the guests’ apartment, and then an
excited calling out for servants, who either could not or
would not hear, followed by a knocking at her own door,
and an agitated demand for laudanum, and a confused story
about salad and punch, which might be the death of people
who suffered from internal complaints. Tea must be
infused, and hot-water bottles filled; but when Jo sprang
up eager to go and help, her husband held her back authoritatively.
He had feigned to be asleep all the time, but
when the door was shut, while the strange sounds continued
to be heard, then he was seized with such an uncontrollable
fit of laughter, that Jo was infected by his merriment, and
lay in mortal terror lest Emily should hear them, or Jan be
awakened.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Jan was the last to think of awaking. He slept
not only the whole night, but far into the morning. Max
was not permitted to go to his office before he should awake,
for just as she would have thought it “very alarming” if he
had not slept at all, so it seemed to be “very alarming” that
he should sleep so long.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, about nine o’clock, he opened his eyes. The
rest seemed to have done him good, for not only did he
demand bread and butter, but, as soon as his glance fell on
the new box of bricks papa had bought for him the day
before, he jumped out of bed, and seated himself on the
floor to play, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is the poor little throat?” asked Jo, as soon as
she had recovered from her glad surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>“My throat?” repeated the child wonderingly; “my
throat is not ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Max was so relieved, and thought it such a capital joke
that he burst out laughing; even the Martendijks laughed;
and Jo tried to join in, but the joy was too sudden after
the anxiety she had undergone, and she broke into a hysterical
fit of weeping instead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There you are now! I told you so—insisting on the
party like that!” cried Van Elst, losing his temper completely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What kind of an outbreak is that?” asked Emily,
forgetting the repairs at home for the moment, in order to
give vent to her indignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it? It is your fault, Emily, if she is laid up.
I could have told you beforehand,—Jo is not fit for all that
worry and fuss!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Emily followed her husband from the room—the thought
of the building recurring to her; while Van Elst led his
wife away.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the doctor came, he spoke of over-excitement,
nervous strain, and prescribed strong beef-tea, absolute
quiet, and keeping to her room. Jo submitted. Jan was
nearly all right again; it had been a mere cold, and in her
joy and gratitude for his recovery, she could have submitted
to much; to remain in one’s room, however, is a trial to
appreciate which one must be the mother of three children.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your visitor can surely manage the house for a few
days?” the doctor had said. But, strangely enough, now
the party was over Cousin Emily seemed totally incapable
of domestic duties.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jo lay listening to piercing cries from Nonnie, who
was evidently tumbling downstairs, and hungry little Ada’s
wails would penetrate to her ears; or the maid would appear
one moment, the “boy” the next, to ply her with questions.
Worse than all were the fears she created for herself,—Jan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>would be sure to catch cold, or the children would venture
too near the well or the cistern; who was to put away all
the plate and crystal? and would not the servants appropriate
all the remains of the feast?</p>

<p class='c009'>Luckily Van Elst came home early; but he brought no
balm to Jo’s heart, for when he saw that she was no better,
he began by scolding her, and then abruptly left the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the very opportunity his neighbour over the way
had been watching for.</p>

<p class='c009'>With apparent unconcern he sauntered across his own
grounds, where he had lain in ambush for some time; for
ever since he had witnessed the doctor’s repeated visits, his
curiosity had known no bounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr Van Elst,” he began, feigning great surprise
at meeting him there, “and how are you all at home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, first-rate,” said Van Elst; “mother sick, child
sick, and husband no longer master in his own house!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless me!” said Mr Smits. “Come, I’ll walk up and
down a bit with you. I understand how it is when the wife
is ill, especially a wife like yours, but we’ll hope she’ll soon
be herself again. And then things will be all right, won’t
they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was very diplomatic on Mr Smits’s part; he wanted
to know about more than the wife’s illness. It was a
well-calculated move, for the whole story came out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>All right!</em> No, indeed, we shall not. What upsets
my temper is those guests of mine. You will hardly believe,
Mr Smits, what a tiresome, irritating fellow that Martendijk
is, with his terror of infection, and his eternal complaints
about his health. And what a heartless creature his wife
is! But, above all, what studied egoists they both are!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Smits had to hear it all; how worn-out Jo was; how
their guests had taken advantage of them; how he had
been driven into giving that confounded party. “And if I
could once for all just give them a piece of my mind—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>you see I can’t, as they are my guests. My wife is
always giving me nudges and winks to keep me quiet; and
if I do break loose occasionally, I get nice little scoldings
from her into the bargain. Oh, there’s no standing the life
I lead just now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is there no chance of their leaving soon?” asked
Mr Smits.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! they talk of remaining another month at least,”
replied Van Elst, in so despairing a tone, that his neighbour
pitied him from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if there are unwelcome guests in one’s house, it’s
surely easy to find some way of getting rid of them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know any way. They are not particularly
sensitive on some points.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may ask what old Smits has to do with it,” began
the bachelor; “but you must remember I have gradually
grown to take an interest in you and your wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take care, Mr Smits, I am jealous,” cried Max, who
had totally recovered his good-humour now he had unbosomed
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Absurd! an old fellow of sixty!” said Mr Smits, not a
little flattered. “But what I wanted to ask you was, may I
try to devise some plan for your deliverance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; and if you succeed I’ll be grateful to you all
my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first thing put into Van Elst’s hand next morning,
when he sat down to his early coffee in the verandah, was
a carefully sealed note from his old neighbour over the way.
It was concise, and to the point.</p>

<p class='c022'>“<span class='sc'>Friend</span>,—Your wife is feverish. Your cousin has a
dread of infection. Is there any danger of typhus?—Yours,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Smits</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>With a heartier laugh than he had indulged in for a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>time, Van Elst sprang to his feet. “The very thing! What
a capital idea!” He would take steps at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is Cousin Jo?” asked Emily half-an-hour later at
the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No better,” said Max gravely; “I would not go near her
if I were you, Cousin Emily; I think she’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor came, and pronounced the patient convalescent;
so he sat chatting sociably with her for some time, and
then left her, prescribing a tonic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely was he gone when Max joined his cousins in the
front verandah.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a long time the doctor stayed,” Emily remarked.
“It’s nothing serious, is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Elst preserved an ominous silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cousin Jo will soon be going about again, I hope?”
asked Martendijk, with some concern; for domestic affairs
had not gone so smoothly, nor had they, personally, fared so
well, since Mrs Van Elst had been laid up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Max’s face assumed a very serious expression. “Going
about! No, indeed, not for a while yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you see—h’m—after all,” said Max, as if making
a sudden resolve, “I think it’s best to tell you frankly,
the doctor is afraid of typhus fever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Typhus!</em>” shrieked Martendijk. “Good Heavens!
Emily, d’ye hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Emily, and, to her credit, we must confess
that her first thoughts flew to the poor husband and children,
who, if the worst should happen, would lose so devoted a
wife and mother. “Alas! Cousin Max,” she said, “how
terrible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was the doctor quite sure of it?” asked Martendijk, his
face blanched with mortal terror, the remembrance of which
long remained an unfailing source of amusement to Van
Elst.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>“No, not at all certain; he thought it might perhaps be
small-pox,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Martendijk stared at him in the wildest consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good God!” he stammered, “that’s no trifle either.
Small-pox and typhus fever! One every bit as infectious as
the other!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Max, “small-pox especially. Well, I’m off
to the office,” he concluded. “Good-morning, you’ll go
and see after my wife every now and then, won’t you,
Emily?” he asked, as he sprang into his <em>bendy</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Emily, indeed you’ll do nothing of the kind, I
hope,” cried Martendijk, as soon as Van Elst was beyond
earshot. “You might bring back infection, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! Piet, you really are rather a coward in that respect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but, Emily, <em>small-pox</em>! Just fancy if you were to
take it——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, of course; but you need not be so ready to
accept it as a fact. If Max were sure of it he would not
have been so calm about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dearest,” and Piet’s voice was as meek as any child’s, “I
hope you agree with me, we must get away from this <em>at once</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would people say if we left Jo——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! my dearest wife, do not agitate me with all these
objections!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks so cowardly, Piet. And the climate here agrees
with you so well. And the building is not finished yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we must just make the best of it. Anything rather
than remain in this infected atmosphere. Oh, Emily, dearest
Emily, have you no more affection for your husband? O Lord!
the pain, the pain! The shock has set it going again!”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>When Van Elst came home from his office at mid-day,
his “boy” brought him another letter. It was not from
Smits this time, however, but from the Martendijks.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>“<span class='sc'>Dear Cousins</span> (it ran),—You will quite understand
our haste to get away, now your house is attacked by such
a terrible epidemic. We would willingly have remained
much longer, and it is our intention to repeat our visit soon.</p>

<p class='c022'>“In the meantime accept our cordial thanks for the
hospitality you have shown to us.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Though your behaviour to us has not been all it might
have been, dear Cousin Max, we do not bear you the
slightest grudge, and are quite ready to excuse it, knowing
what a bad effect the liver has on the temper.</p>

<p class='c022'>“We wish dear Jo a speedy recovery, and earnestly
trust that she may be spared to her husband and children.—With
our kindest regards, your affectionate cousins,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>P. &amp; E. Martendijk</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“Hurrah!” exclaimed Van Elst. “Hurrah! Jo! our
guests are gone!”</p>

<p class='c022'>Though Jo received the news with considerable consternation,
and thought it disgraceful and inexcusable in Max to
joke about anything so terrible as typhus fever (in which
Max agreed with her penitently), it was amazing how rapidly
she sprang out of bed,—the departure of her guests proving
more effective than all the doctor’s tonics.</p>

<p class='c022'>So when their old neighbour strolled past the Van Elsts’
house a little later, with an air of indifference, and Max
rushed out to tell him the glad news, and to thank him for
his friendly and timely help, he found Mrs Van Elst in the
verandah, as bright and merry as ever, ready to assure him—though
she insisted on thinking it a disgraceful proceeding!—that
he had done her a great service by his lucky inspiration.</p>

<p class='c022'>An invitation to a quiet dinner on the following day was
the result; and the dinner was so good, the host in such excellent
spirits, and the hostess so sweet, that the solitary old
bachelor caught himself thinking, as he always did when
a spectator of the Van Elsts’ domestic bliss, “I might have
known this sort of thing too, if only——”</p>

<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>Buning, Arnold Werumeus</span>, born at Uithuizen (Groningen), in 1846,
and served in the Dutch navy from 1861 to 1876, when he was
forced by ill-health to retire on a pension. He then settled in his
native town, but afterwards removed to the Hague, where he now
lives. He is the author of a great number of short stories, mostly
more or less naval, and one or more novels, of which the principal is
“The Burgomaster’s Inheritance” (Leyden, 1873), and frequently contributes
to <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Eigen Haard</span></cite> and Elsevier’s <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geïllustreerd Maandschrift</span></cite>.
He is not remarkable for the subtleties of humour, his genius being
more akin to the rattling fun and boisterous spirits of such writers
as Captain Marryat and the late Henry Kingsley. But he can be
touching too, and there is unaffected pathos as well as fun in the
little volume, “Marim-Schetsen,” from which our extract is taken.
The education of the orphan boy by his father’s old mate, “The
Red ’Un,” who trains him up with unsparing rigour in the way in
which all good sailors should go, is good in both ways; so is the
sketch (in <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verschillende Ouwe Heeren</span></cite>) of old Jan Hallema, the
Hilligermond pilot.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Cats, Jacob</span>,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a> born at Brouwershaven, in Zeeland, 1577; died September
12, 1660; and was buried in the Kloosterkerk at the Hague.
He studied law at Leyden, and then travelled in France and Italy.
Returning, he practised as a lawyer in his native town for some
years. His health gave way, and he visited England in order to
consult Dr William Butler, at Cambridge, but received no benefit.
He went home to die, but was unexpectedly cured by a strolling
alchemist. He then settled at Middleburgh, and married. His
profession seems to have left him abundant leisure for poetry, and
for enjoying the society of his family at his country place of Grypskerke.
It was during this period he produced his “Emblems of
Fancy and Love,” “Galatea,” “Mirror of Past and Present,” and
“Marriage” (Houwelick). In 1621 he was appointed Pensionary
(stipendiary magistrate) of Middleburgh, and in 1623 transferred
to the same office at Dordrecht. In 1627 he was sent on a diplomatic
mission to England, and knighted by Charles I. After his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>return he lost his wife, and dedicated to her memory the <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Trouwringh</span></cite>
(“Wedding Ring”), published in 1635. In 1636 he was
chosen Grand Pensionary of Holland, resigned his office in 1651,
and in 1657 went on another unsuccessful embassy to England,
where he delivered a Latin oration before the House of Commons.
On coming back to Holland he retired to his villa of Zorgvliet,
near the Hague, where he devoted himself once more to farming and
poetry, and died at the age of seventy-three. He has always been a
most popular writer in Holland, his mixture of canny morality and
shrewd homely wit being in thorough accordance with the national
genius, which found his long-windedness no drawback. His reputation
for “soundness,” and his tendency to preach also, no doubt
secured his popularity among a nation peculiarly suspicious of
heterodoxy, frivolity, and anything “without a moral at the end,”
though it must be said that his notions of propriety appear to be
somewhat large when judged by present-day standards. It may
seem difficult to believe, after all this, that he possessed the faintest
spark of humour; but his shrewd mother wit makes him sometimes
amusing, even to an outsider, and now and then he records a touch
of that “detached outlook in life, which goes to the making of a
real humorist.” Southey, who read Dutch among other things,
and was probably introduced to a great deal of Dutch literature
by the poet Bilderdijk, has a highly complimentary reference to
him in the epistle to Allan Cunningham:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>... “Father Cats,</div>
      <div class='line'>The household poet, teacheth in his songs</div>
      <div class='line'>The love of all things lovely, all things pure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Best poet, who delights the cheerful mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Of childhood, stores with moral strength the heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Of youth, with wisdom maketh mid-life rich,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fills with quiet tears the eye of age.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>Cats’ works used to occupy in Dutch households the position of the
“Pilgrim’s Progress” and Fox’s “Book of Martyrs” in old-fashioned
English ones. He is still popular, not only among his Protestant
countrymen, but even in Belgium, and a complete edition of his
works has lately been issued at Antwerp. It includes a large
collection of proverbs, some of the quainter ones being given in the
text. A translation of some of his “Zinne-Beelden” was published,
under the title of “Moral Emblems,” by Richard Pigott, in 1860,
in a large and handsome volume, with reproductions of the
original woodcuts.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span><span class='sc'>Cremer, Jacobus Jan</span>, born at Arnheim in 1827, is now living at the
Hague. He devoted himself for a time to painting, but in time
entirely abandoned the pencil for the pen. He is most successful
in his village stories, the best being located in his native “Betuwe,”
which he calls “The Paradise of Holland.” The list of his works,
which include novels, short stories, and sketches (published in serial
collections), and plays, is far too long to reproduce. Like Dickens,
he was at one time conspicuously successful in giving readings and
recitations from his own works.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Dekker, Edward Douwes</span>, best known by the pseudonym of
<em>Multatuli</em>, was born at Amsterdam, March 2, 1820. He went to
Java in 1840 or 1841, with his father, the captain of a vessel, and
shortly afterwards obtained a Government clerkship. After a
succession of appointments in different places, at one of which he
made the acquaintance of the lady who afterwards became his first
wife,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> he became “Assistant Resident” at Lebak,—a post which
he threw up in 1856, because the Governor-General would not
listen to his representations with regard to the extortion and
tyranny practised by the native chiefs, and (indirectly) by the
Dutch Government. Coming home, he embodied his opinions
and experiences in the novel of “Max Havelaar,” which, crude
and formless as a literary production, startled the reading public
with its origin and audacity, and, having regard to the effect it
produced, may fitly be called the Dutch “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
For some time after landing in Holland he and his family were in
the greatest distress, as through his hasty resignation he had forfeited
the pension which would have been due to him in another
year or two. He obtained some grudging help from his wife’s
relations, who offered to provide for her entirely if she would leave
him, and were righteously indignant at her refusal. With the
appearance of “Max Havelaar” his success as a literary man was
assured, and from thenceforth he was able to live by his pen,
though continually harassed by debts (he was careless, generous,
and extravagant, and had a constitutional incapacity for accounts),
controversies, and quarrels, well or ill founded, with friends or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>foes. After the death of his first wife, he was married a second
time—to Mej. Schepeles—and made his home in the Rhineland,
first at Niederingelheim, and then at Wiesbaden. He died at
Mainz, in February 1887. Perhaps his best work is to be found in
the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ideen</span></cite> (filling in the collected edition of his works some seven
volumes). They are a kind of continuous rambling <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">causerie</span></i>,
contributed to a Dutch daily, the <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dageraad</span></cite>, and ranging over
every possible topic, full of aphorism, paradox, epigram, and with
an occasional story woven in here and there. The most important
of these is the delightful fictitious biography of Wouter Pieterse,
which, though certainly not an autobiography, incorporates many
of the experiences of his childhood and youth. It was never
finished, and proceeds in a most capricious manner, being frequently
interrupted by digressions for dozens of pages together,
and then suddenly taken up again. Some extracts are given from
this and other parts of the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ideen</span></cite>. Most of his other works, except
the dramas “The Bride in Heaven” and “The School for
Princes,” are of a more or less occasional and fugitive character.
But Multatuli’s position is not to be measured by the mere number
and extent of his works. He is a distinct force in modern Holland,
and a name to conjure with to the younger generation of Dutch
readers.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Eeden, F. van</span>, is the editor of the <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Gids</span></cite>, and author of novels,
sketches, critical articles, &amp;c., besides the poem “Ellen,” and
some plays, including the comedy from which our quotation is
taken, and a farce, “The Student at Home.”</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Foore, Annie</span>, is the pseudonym of Mevrouw W. J. F. Ijzerman,
whose maiden name was Francisca J. J. A. Junius, daughter of a
learned theologian, the minister of Tiel. She was born at the
latter place in 1847, and married an engineer, at Padang, Sumatra,
in 1873. Her principal works are the novels, “The Colonial and
his Superior” (1877), “A Family Secret,” “Florence’s Dream,”
and several volumes of short stories. The specimens in the present
volume are taken from “Family Life in the East Indies.” She has
great power of observation, a fine sense of humour, and an easy
flowing style of narrative, though sometimes her stories are defective
in construction. Her pictures of colonial life are admirable. For
the translation of the story “Unbidden Guests,” I am indebted
to Miss Margaret Farquharson, of Selkirk.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Huygens, Constantijn</span>, born 1596, at the Hague. His godfathers
were the Admiral Justinus von Nassau and the City of Breda; he
was named after the “constancy” shown by the latter to the House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>of Orange. He enjoyed a singularly complete and brilliant education,
studied law at Leyden, and became, in 1625, private secretary
to Prince Frederick Henry. He was on friendly terms with Hooft,
Cats, and the beautiful and talented daughters of Roemer Visscher,—Anna
and Tesselschade. Like Cats, he had visited England (in
1618), where he made the acquaintance of John Donne, whose
poems he afterwards translated, and whose influence is visible in
his writings. He was knighted by James I. in 1622. He married
in 1627, and the loss of his wife, ten years later, was the great
affliction of his life. He had four sons, the second being the
celebrated mathematician, Christian Huygens, and one daughter.
He continued his political activity till 1672, when, being to a certain
extent superseded on account of his advanced age, he devoted
himself to literature and (like most Dutch gentlemen) to gardening
at his villa of Hofwijk, near the Hague; he died there in 1687.
His works are of various kinds,—didactic and descriptive poems
(“Batava Tempe”), satires (“The Costly Request”), epigrams
(we give a few translations), the frightfully coarse farce of “Trijntje
Cornelis” (taste of the times again!), &amp;c. His best poem is
“<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oogentrost</span>” (Eye Comfort), dedicated, in 1647, to a friend,
Lucretia van Trello, who feared she was going blind. He also
wrote a Latin autobiography, under the title “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Vita Propria
Sermones</span>.” He published his collected poems under the title
“Corn Flowers.” Personally he seems to have been in every way

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Keller, Gerard</span>, born at Gouda, February 13, 1829. He was for
some time stenographer to the Dutch parliament, and afterwards
editor of the <cite>Arnheimsche Courant</cite>. He is a clever journalist, and
voluminous writer of fiction, in which latter department he would
appear to have been influenced by Dickens. His earliest novel,
“The Tutor’s Family,” appeared in 1857; “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Overkompleet</span>,” the
sketch from which our extract is taken, appeared in a volume with
other short stories in 1871, but has been reprinted in a complete
edition of his “Novellen,” of which three volumes have already seen
the light. Among his other novels we may mention “The Mortgage
on Wasenstein” (1866), “The History of a Halfpenny, and
other Stories” (1872), “Off the Rails” (1872), &amp;c. He is also
the author of several volumes of travel-sketches, among which we
may mention four illustrated quarto volumes, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amerika in Beeld
en Schrift</span>,” and a lively description of a tour in Scotland (“<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een
Uitstapje naar de Schotsche Hooglanden</span>”), which has appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>quite recently. Keller acted as a newspaper correspondent in
France during the Franco-German War, and his experiences there
resulted in two books, “Paris Besieged” and “Paris Murdered.”
Besides all this he has written several comedies, and numerous
contributions to periodical literature, and is now, we believe, the
editor of the monthly magazine, <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Vreemd en Eigen</span></cite>, having previously
edited, at different times, <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kunst Kroniek</span></cite> and the <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geldersche
Almanach</span></cite>. His style has a lightness of touch, perhaps due to
French influence, and conspicuously wanting in all but some of the
most recent Dutch authors, with the exception of Multatuli.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Lamberts-hurrelbrinck</span>, L. H. J., is a young writer, living at
Leyden, who has published more than one collection of short
stories, mostly dealing with the province of Limburg and its people.
His first volume, “Limburgsche Novellen,” was reviewed, with
perhaps undue severity, in <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De Gids</span></cite> for July 1890—a judgment
which, it is said, was not altogether uninfluenced by party spirit.
A later volume is “Van Limburg’s Bodem.” The sketch in the
text appeared in <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Elsevier’s Maandschrift</span></cite> for September 1892, and
is to a certain extent founded on fact.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Lennep, Jacob van</span>, one of the best known of modern Dutch writers.
Belonging to a literary family, he was born at Amsterdam in 1802,
studied at Leyden, and took a law degree in 1824, and settled as a
lawyer at Amsterdam. In 1854–56 he was a member of the Second
Chamber of the States-General. He died at Oosterbeek (Gelderland)
on August 25, 1868. His literary industry was so prodigious
that we cannot attempt to give a list of his works, which were
chiefly poems, novels (published in a collected edition of 19 vols.),
plays, and historical studies. Perhaps his best novel is “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Klaasje
Zevenster</span>,” from which the bit of description we have quoted is
taken. We give his comedy, “The Village on the Frontier,”
entire.</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>Seipgens, Emile Anton Hubert</span>, born at Roermond (Limburg),
August 16, 1837. He was at first in the brewing business, but is
now a teacher of German language and literature in the “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rijks
Hoogere Burgerschool</span>” of his native town. He has written
several plays, some of them in the Roermond dialect, and two or
three volumes of short stories, most of them strongly “Limburgsch”
in local colour. The extract here given is taken from
the volume entitled “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">In en om het klein Stadje</span>” (Amsterdam,
1887). Another collection is entitled “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Langs Maas en Geul</span>.”
He is an occasional contributor to the monthly magazine <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De Gids</span></cite>,
and also to Elsevier’s “Illustrated.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The oldest “Chambers of Rhetoric” (or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Collèges de Rhétorique</span></i>—the name probably
originated in the French influence introduced by the House of Burgundy)
date back to about 1400, or some years previous. The oldest would seem to be the
“Alpha and Omega,” at Ypres, and the Antwerp “Violieren” (wall-flowers). The
most famous, perhaps, is the Amsterdam association, “De Eglantier,” better known
perhaps under the name of its motto, “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">In Liefde Bloeiende</span>” (Blooming in Love).
They held poetical competitions, placed upon the stage (usually with great magnificence)
plays written and acted by their members, and arranged the most splendid pageants
and processions on the occasion of any festival or public rejoicing. They also
celebrated festivals of their own, the most important of which were known by the
name of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landjuweelen</span></i>. In 1496 a great Landjuweel was held at Antwerp by twenty-eight
societies, at which the Eglantier gained the first prize. But the most famous of
all was the Landjuweel of 1561, also held at Antwerp, beginning on the 3rd August,
when the chambers of Brabant and Flanders vied with one another in magnificence.
The Brussels society, “The Book,” was represented by 340 members, all on horseback
in crimson mantles. This festival was revived on the occasion of the jubilee of
the Belgian Academy of Antiquities, August 1892.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The plot of the “Bride in Heaven” is briefly this:—Many years before the opening
of the play, Major Huser had killed Baron Van Bergen in a duel. There was no
personal enmity between the men,—indeed they were intimate friends; it was only
public opinion and a barbarous etiquette that forced on this ending to a trifling
dispute. Huser was broken-hearted at the way it ended: he accepted the charge of
Van Bergen’s only son as a sacred trust; and when he died, shortly afterwards, made
his own son, Gustaaf, promise to be a friend to young Van Bergen at any sacrifice.
Van Bergen turned out wild and dissipated, and Gustaaf redeemed his promise by
taking on himself a forgery committed by his friend when in desperate straits for lack
of money at the university. No one knew the truth of this affair but himself, Van
Bergen, and the latter’s worthless valet, Frans. The proofs of the whole were contained
in certain letters in Van Bergen’s possession. Huser disappears from society,
and is supposed to have fled the country. As a matter of fact, he is getting his
living as a music-master, under the name of Holm, and as such he is introduced to us
in the play. His principal pupil is Caroline, daughter of a high government official
named Van Wachler,—a shrewd, honourable, and upright man, of simple tastes,
meeting with little sympathy from his fashionable and affected wife, with her would-be
French manners, and the aristocratic connections she will not allow him to forget.
Mevrouw Van Wachler is young Van Bergen’s aunt, and exceedingly anxious to
marry her daughter to the scapegrace, who, for his part, is not unwilling to accept
such a way of escape from his embarrassments. Her husband is less dazzled by the
match, and declares his intention of letting his daughter choose for herself. He
questions her, and finds that her affections are set on Holm. Holm, who has meanwhile
awakened to the fact that he is in love with Caroline, has made up his mind
that he must leave without a sign; but Van Wachler’s genial kindness wins his secret
from him, and, finding that the statesman respects him for himself, and is willing to
take his position and his past for granted, and that all he has to do is, to consent to
the engagement, he can only shut his eyes for the moment, and accept the offered
happiness. In the second act, which, with a few unimportant abridgments, is
given entire in the text, General Van Weller, brother to Mevrouw Van Wachler,
and the elder Huser’s old friend and comrade, returns from the Indies, determined
to clear up the mystery of Gustaaf Huser’s disappearance, and is unwittingly
helped on to the right track by Frans. In the third act, Holm and Van
Bergen meet—the best side of the latter comes uppermost, and he has a passing
mood of repentance and reconciliation. But Frans’ influence is too strong; he is
persuaded to take a base advantage of his rival, and tells the Van Wachler family, in
Holm’s presence, that the latter is not only passing under a false name, but is an
outlaw and a convicted felon. Holm (who had previously made up his mind, for the
sake of their old friendship and his promise to his father, to renounce Caroline, in the
hope that her love—could he succeed in winning it—might save Van Bergen) is
stunned and driven to despair by this treacherous attack, goes home to his lodgings,
and is about to commit suicide, when he is interrupted by a visit from a man whose
children he saved from a fire a year ago, and who has now brought them to see him.
This man (Wolf) discovers his purpose, and does not leave till he has persuaded him
to forego it. Scarcely has he gone, when Caroline comes in. She tells Holm that
she has come to bid him farewell, but that nothing that has happened can make any
possible difference to their love. If she may not belong to him on earth, she will be
his bride in the other life, and wait for him there. So they part.</p>

<p class='c009'>Van Wachler is full of indignation at the way in which he considers himself to have
been deceived by Holm, but Van Weller arrives in time to explain everything,—tells
the whole story, sends for Holm, or Huser, and sees his old friend’s son triumphantly
righted, while Van Bergen retires in disgrace. (See <em>A Rascally Valet</em>, p. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>.)</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. This story appears to have several morals, the reader being left free
to choose the one most in accordance with his own views. The author
himself is strictly impartial. Perhaps the most obvious is, that it is not
good to match your wits against those of the Roman Catholic clergy,
unless you have capital to back your opposition, and not always even
then. M. Seipgens does not obtrude his own views, and we are not
quite sure whether the conclusion is meant to be serious and edifying, or
whether there is an underlying <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pointe d’ironie</span></i>. The story gives a lively
picture of life and manners in the Limburg district, that picturesque
and little known region which, though part of Holland, is in some
respects so un-Dutch. The language spoken there is less like Dutch
proper than some broad and harsh dialect of German, such as they
speak about Cologne. After some hesitation between the two, we have
given this sketch of Seipgens’ in preference to “Kobus Mulders’ Vote,”—which
also turns on politics and clerical influence, and is, in some
respects, more characteristic; but the crisis—when Mulders and his
family are cut off by the flood—comes too near tragedy for such a book
as this.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. The scene of this play is laid on what is now the frontier between
Holland and Belgium,—the time is 1830,—when the southern provinces
of the Kingdom of Holland revolted. The Liberal (French) party
allied itself with the Clerical Ultramontanes against the Government,
and the news of the Paris Revolution precipitated the outbreak of a
riot at Brussels (August 25), which soon spread over the country.</p>

<p class='c022'>“<em>We seem at last to be shown men and women as they are; and at first it
is more than we can endure.... All Ibsen’s characters speak and act as if
they were hypnotized, and under their creator’s imperious demand to reveal
themselves. There never was such a mirror held up to nature before: it is
too terrible.... Yet we must return to Ibsen, with his remorseless surgery,
his remorseless electric-light, until we, too, have grown strong and learned to
face the naked—if necessary, the flayed and bleeding—reality.</em>”—<span class='sc'>Speaker</span>

<p class='c009'>Dramatic Criticism, as we now understand it—the systematic appraisement
from day to day and week to week of contemporary plays and
acting—began in England about the beginning of the present century.
Until very near the end of the eighteenth century, “the critics” gave
direct utterance to their judgments in the theatre itself, or in the coffeehouses,
only occasionally straying into print in letters to the news-sheets,
or in lampoons or panegyrics in prose or verse, published in pamphlet
form. Modern criticism began with modern journalism; but some of
its earliest utterances were of far more than ephemeral value. During
the earlier half of the present century several of the leading essayists of
the day—men of the first literary eminence—concerned themselves largely
with the theatre. Under the title of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='large'>“DRAMATIC ESSAYS”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>will be issued, in three volumes, such of their theatrical criticisms as seem
to be of abiding interest.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>THE FIRST SERIES</em> will contain selections from the criticisms
of LEIGH HUNT, both those published in 1807 (long out of print), and
the admirable articles contributed more than twenty years later to <cite>The
Tatler</cite>, and never republished.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>THE SECOND SERIES</em> will contain selections from the criticisms
of WILLIAM HAZLITT. Hazlitt’s Essays on Kean and his contemporaries
have long been inaccessible, save to collectors.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>THE THIRD SERIES</em> will contain hitherto uncollected criticisms
by JOHN FORSTER, GEORGE HENRY LEWES, and others, with
selections from the writings of WILLIAM ROBSON (The Old Playgoer).</p>

<p class='c009'>The Essays will be concisely but adequately annotated, and each
volume will contain an Introduction by <span class='sc'>William Archer</span>, and an
Engraved Portrait Frontispiece.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Of the very few books on art that painters and critics should on no
account leave unread this is surely one.”—<cite>The Studio.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“His book is one of the best books about pictures that have come
into our hands for some years.”—<cite>St. James’s Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“If there is an art critic who knows exactly what he means and says
it with exemplary lucidity, it is ‘G. M.’”—<cite>The Sketch.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“A more original, a better informed, a more suggestive, and let us
add, a more amusing work on the art of to-day, we have never read
than this volume.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“Impressionism, to use that word, in the absence of any fitter
one,—the impressionism which makes his own writing on art in this
volume so effective, is, in short, the secret both of his likes and
dislikes, his hatred of what he thinks conventional and mechanic,
together with his very alert and careful evaluation of what comes home
to him as straightforward, whether in Reynolds, or Rubens, or Ruysdael,
in Japan, in Paris, or in modern England.”—Mr. Pater in <cite>The
Chronicle</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As an art critic Mr. George Moore certainly has some signal
advantages. He is never dull, he is frankly personal, he is untroubled
by tradition.”—<cite>Westminster Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Moore, in spite of the impediments that he puts in the way of
his own effectiveness, is one of the most competent writers on painting
that we have.”—<cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“His [Mr. Moore’s] book is one that cannot fail to be much talked
about; and everyone who is interested in modern painting will do well
to make acquaintance with its views.”—<cite>Scottish Leader.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“As everybody knows by this time, Mr. Moore is a person of strong
opinions and strong dislikes, and has the gift of expressing both in
pungent language.”—<cite>The Times.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“Of his [Mr. Moore’s] sincerity, of his courage, and of his candour
there can be no doubt.... One of the most interesting writers on art
that we have.”—<cite>Pall Mall Gazette.</cite></p>

  </div>

<p class='c009'>“‘A Mummer’s Wife’ is a striking book—clever, unpleasant,
realistic.... No one who wishes to examine the subject of realism
in fiction, with regard to English novels, can afford to neglect ‘A
Mummer’s Wife.’”—<cite>Athenæum.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“‘A Mummer’s Wife,’ in virtue of its vividness of presentation and
real literary skill, may be regarded as in some degree a representative
example of the work of a literary school that has of late years attracted
to itself a great deal of notoriety.”—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

admirable treatment of the great sacrifice she makes.”—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

are drawn with patient care, and with a power of individualisation
which marks the born novelist. It is a serious, powerful, and in many
respects edifying book.”—<cite>Pall Mall Gazette.</cite></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
